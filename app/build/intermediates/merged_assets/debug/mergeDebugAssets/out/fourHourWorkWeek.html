I wrote it with two of my closest friends in mind, speaking directly to them and their problems&mdash;problems I long had&mdash;and I focused on the unusual options that had worked for me around the world. </span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c4">I certainly tried to set conditions for making a sleeper hit possible, but I knew it wasn&rsquo;t likely. I hoped for the best and planned for the worst. </span></p><p class="c82 c43"><span class="c4">May 2, 2007, I receive a call on my cell phone from my editor. &ldquo;Tim, you hit the list.&rdquo; It was just past 5 </span><span class="c3">P.M</span><span class="c4">. in New York City, and I was exhausted. The book had launched five days before, and I had just finished a series of more than twenty radio interviews in succession, beginning at 6 </span><span class="c3">A.M</span><span class="c4">. that morning. I never planned a book tour, preferring instead to &ldquo;batch&rdquo; radio satellite tours into 48 hours. </span></p><p class="c64"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Heather, I love you, but please don&rsquo;t $#%* with me.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c32 c43 c41"><span class="c4">&ldquo;No, you really hit the list. Congratulations, Mr. </span><span class="c17">New York Times </span><span class="c4">bestselling author!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c4">I leaned against the wall and slid down until I was sitting on the floor. I closed my eyes, smiled, and took a deep breath. Things were about to change. </span></p><p class="c78 c250"><span class="c4">Everything was about to change. </span></p><p class="c260"><span class="c13">Lifestyle Design from Dubai to Berlin </span></p><p class="c43 c248"><span class="c6">T</span><span class="c17">he 4-Hour Workweek </span><span class="c4">has now been sold into 35 languages. It&rsquo;s been on the bestseller lists for more than two years, and every month brings a new story and a new discovery. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">From the </span><span class="c17">Economist </span><span class="c4">to the cover of the </span><span class="c17">New York Times Style </span><span class="c4">section, from the streets of Dubai to the cafes of Berlin, lifestyle design has cut across cultures to become a worldwide movement. The original ideas of the book have been broken apart, improved, and tested in environments and ways I never could have imagined. </span></p><p class="c78 c43 c41"><span class="c4">So why the new edition if things are working so well? Because I knew it could be better, and there was a missing ingredient: you. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">This expanded and updated edition contains more than 100 pages of new content, including the latest cutting-edge technologies, field-tested resources, and&mdash;most important&mdash;real-world success stories chosen from more than 400 pages of case studies submitted by readers. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">Families and students? CEOs and professional vagabonds? Take your pick. There should be someone whose results you can duplicate. Need a template to negotiate remote work, a paid year in Argentina, perhaps? This time, it&rsquo;s in here. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">The Experiments in Lifestyle Design blog (</span><span class="c7">www.fourhourblog.com</span><span class="c4">) was launched alongside the book, and within six months, it became one of the top 1,000 blogs in the world, out of more than 120 million. Thousands of readers have shared their own amazing tools and tricks, producing phenomenal and unexpected results. The blog became the laboratory I&rsquo;d always wanted, and I encourage you to join us there. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">The new &ldquo;Best of the Blog&rdquo; section includes several of the most popular posts from the Experiments in Lifestyle Design blog. On the blog itself, you can also find recommendations from everyone from Warren Buffett (seriously, I tracked him down and show you how I did it) to chess prodigy Josh Waitzkin. It&rsquo;s an experimental playground for those who want better results in less time. </span></p><p class="c205"><span class="c13">Not &ldquo;Revised&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c58 c43"><span class="c6">T</span><span class="c4">his is not a &ldquo;revised&rdquo; edition in the sense that the original no longer works. The typos and small mistakes have been fixed over more than 40 printings in the U.S. This is the first major overhaul, but not for the reason you&rsquo;d expect. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">Things have changed dramatically since April 2007. Banks are failing, retirement and pension funds are evaporating, and jobs are being lost at record rates. Readers and skeptics alike have asked: Can the principles and techniques in the book really still work in an economic recession or depression? </span></p><p class="c38"><span class="c4">Yes and yes. In fact, questions I posed during pre-crash lectures, including &ldquo;How would your priorities and decisions change if you could never retire?&rdquo; are no longer hypothetical. Millions of people have seen their savings portfolios fall 40% or more in value and are now looking for options C and D. Can they redistribute retirement throughout life to make it more affordable? Can they relocate a few months per year to a place like Costa Rica or Thailand to multiply the lifestyle output of their decreased savings? Sell their services to companies in the UK to earn in a stronger currency? The answer to all of them is, more than ever, yes. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">The concept of lifestyle design as a replacement for multi-staged career planning is sound. It&rsquo;s more flexible and allows you to test different lifestyles without committing to a 10- or 20-year retirement plan that can fail due to market fluctuations outside of your control. People are open to exploring alternatives (and more forgiving of others who do the same), as many of the other options&mdash;the once &ldquo;safe&rdquo; options&mdash;have failed. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">When everything and everyone is failing, what is the cost of a little experimentation outside of the norm? Most often, nothing. Flash forward to 2011; is a job interviewer asking about that unusual gap year? </span></p><p class="c78 c43 c41"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Everyone was getting laid off and I had a once-in-a-lifetime chance to travel around the world. It was incredible.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c115 c43"><span class="c4">If anything, they&rsquo;ll ask you how to do the same. The scripts in this book still work. Facebook and LinkedIn launched in the post-2000 dot-com &ldquo;depression.&rdquo; Other recession-born babies include Monopoly, Apple, Cliff Bar, Scrabble, KFC, Domino&rsquo;s Pizza, FedEx, and Microsoft. This is no coincidence, as economic downturns produce discounted infrastructure, outstanding freelancers at bargain prices, and rock-bottom advertising deals&mdash;all impossible when everyone is optimistic. </span></p><p class="c57 c41"><span class="c4">Whether a yearlong sabbatical, a new business idea, reengineering your life within the corporate beast, or dreams you&rsquo;ve postponed for &ldquo;some day,&rdquo; there has never been a better time for testing the uncommon. What&rsquo;s the worst that could happen? I encourage you to remember this often-neglected question as you begin to see the infinite possibilities outside of your current comfort zone. This period of collective panic is your big chance to dabble. </span></p><p class="c32 c43 c41"><span class="c4">It&rsquo;s been an honor to share the last two years with incredible readers around the world, and I hope you enjoy this new edition as much as I enjoyed putting it together. </span></p><p class="c82 c343"><span class="c4">I am, and will continue to be, a humble student of you all. </span></p><p class="c37"><span class="c17">Un abrazo fuerte</span><span class="c4">, </span></p><p class="c113 c152"><span class="c4">T</span><span class="c3">IM </span><span class="c4">F</span><span class="c3">ERRISS </span></p><p class="c105 c43"><span class="c17">San Franciso, California April 21, 2009 </span></p><p class="c308"><span class="c13">First and Foremost </span></p><p class="c168"><span class="c13">FAQ&mdash;DOUBTERS READ THIS </span></p><p class="c43 c41 c119"><span class="c6">I</span><span class="c4">s lifestyle design for you? Chances are good that it is. Here are some of the most common doubts and fears that people have before taking the leap and joining the New Rich: </span><span class="c249">Do I have to quit or hate my job? Do I have to be a risk-taker? </span></p><p class="c43 c41 c191"><span class="c4">No on all three counts. From using Jedi mind tricks to disappear from the office to designing businesses that finance your lifestyle, there are paths for every comfort level. How does a Fortune 500 employee explore the hidden jewels of China for a month and use technology to cover his tracks? How do you create a hands-off business that generates $80K per month with no management? It&rsquo;s all here. </span></p><p class="c78 c43"><span class="c0">Do I have to be a single twenty-something? </span><span class="c4">Not at all. This book is for anyone who is sick of the deferred-life plan and wants to live life large instead of postpone it. Case studies range from a Lamborghini-driving 21-year-old to a single mother who traveled the world for five months with her two children. If you&rsquo;re sick of the standard menu of options and prepared to enter a world of infinite options, this book is for you. </span></p><p class="c78 c43"><span class="c0">Do I have to travel? I just want more time</span><span class="c4">. No. It&rsquo;s just one option. The objective is to create freedom of time and place and use both however </span><span class="c17">you </span><span class="c4">want. </span></p><p class="c32 c43"><span class="c0">Do I need to be born rich? </span><span class="c4">No. My parents have never made more than $50,000 per year combined, and I&rsquo;ve worked since age 14. I&rsquo;m no Rockefeller and you needn&rsquo;t be either. </span></p><p class="c78 c43"><span class="c0">Do I need to be an Ivy League graduate? </span><span class="c4">Nope. Most of the role models in this book didn&rsquo;t go to the Harvards of the world, and some are dropouts. Top academic institutions are wonderful, but there are unrecognized benefits to not coming out of one. Grads from top schools are funneled into high-income 80-hour-per-week jobs, and 15&ndash;30 years of soul-crushing work has been accepted as the default path. How do I know? I&rsquo;ve been there and seen the destruction. This book reverses it. </span></p><p class="c368"><span class="c13">MY STORY AND WHY YOU NEED THIS BOOK </span></p><p class="c65 c269"><span class="c4">Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect. </span></p><p class="c82 c337"><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c3">MARK TWAIN </span></p><p class="c56 c323"><span class="c4">Anyone who lives within their means suffers from a lack of imagination. &mdash;</span><span class="c3">OSCAR WILDE, </span><span class="c4">Irish dramatist and novelist </span></p><p class="c105 c373"><span class="c6">M</span><span class="c4">y hands were sweating again. </span></p><p class="c217 c68 c41"><span class="c4">Staring down at the floor to avoid the blinding ceiling lights, I was supposedly one of the best in the world, but it just didn&rsquo;t register. My partner Alicia shifted from foot to foot as we stood in line with nine other couples, all chosen from over 1,000 competitors from 29 countries and four continents. It was the last day of the Tango World Championship semifinals, and this was our final run in front of the judges, television cameras, and cheering crowds. The other couples had an average of 15 years together. For us, it was the culmination of 5 months of nonstop 6-hour practices, and finally, it was showtime. </span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c4">&ldquo;How are you doing?&rdquo; Alicia, a seasoned professional dancer, asked me in her distinctly Argentine Spanish. </span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Fantastic. Awesome. Let&rsquo;s just enjoy the music. Forget the crowd&mdash;they&rsquo;re not even here.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">That wasn&rsquo;t entirely true. It was hard to even fathom 50,000 spectators and coordinators in La Rural, even if it was the biggest exhibition hall in Buenos Aires. Through the thick haze of cigarette smoke, you could barely make out the huge undulating mass in the stands, and everywhere there was exposed floor, except the </span></p><p class="c32 c43"><span class="c4">sacred 30&prime; </span><span class="c0">x </span><span class="c4">40&prime; space in the middle of it all. I adjusted my pin-striped suit and fussed with my blue silk handkerchief until it was obvious that I was just fidgeting. </span></p><p class="c38"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Are you nervous?&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not nervous. I&rsquo;m excited. I&rsquo;m just going to have fun and let the rest follow.&rdquo; &ldquo;Number 152, you&rsquo;re up.&rdquo; Our chaperone had done his job, and now it was our turn. I whispered an inside joke to Alicia as we stepped on the hardwood platform: </span><span class="c17">&ldquo;Tranquilo&rdquo;</span><span class="c4">&mdash;Take it easy. She laughed, and at just that moment, I thought to myself, &ldquo;What on earth would I be doing right now, if I hadn&rsquo;t left my job and the U.S. over a year ago?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">The thought vanished as quickly as it had appeared when the announcer came over the loudspeaker and the crowd erupted to match him: &ldquo;Pareja numero 152, Timothy Ferriss y Alicia Monti, Ciudad de Buenos Aires!!!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c82 c126"><span class="c4">We were on, and I was beaming. </span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c4">T</span><span class="c3">HE MOST FUNDAMENTAL </span><span class="c4">of American questions is hard for me to answer these days, and luckily so. If it weren&rsquo;t, you wouldn&rsquo;t be holding this book in your hands. </span></p><p class="c57"><span class="c4">&ldquo;So, what do you do?&rdquo; Assuming you can find me (hard to do), and depending on when you ask me (I&rsquo;d prefer you didn&rsquo;t), I could be racing motorcycles in Europe, scuba diving off a private island in Panama, resting under a palm tree between kickboxing sessions in Thailand, or dancing tango in Buenos Aires. The beauty is, I&rsquo;m not a multimillionaire, nor do I particularly care to be. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">I never enjoyed answering this cocktail question because it reflects an epidemic I was long part of: job descriptions as self-descriptions. If someone asks me now and is anything but absolutely sincere, I explain my lifestyle of mysterious means simply. </span></p><p class="c38"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a drug dealer.&rdquo; Pretty much a conversation ender. It&rsquo;s only half true, besides. The whole truth would take too long. How can I possibly explain that what I do with my time and what I do for money are completely different things? That I work less than four hours per week and make more per month than I used to make in a year? </span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c4">For the first time, I&rsquo;m going to tell you the real story. It involves a quiet subculture of people called the &ldquo;New Rich.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c78 c43 c41"><span class="c4">What does an igloo-dwelling millionaire do that a cubicle-dweller doesn&rsquo;t? Follow an uncommon set of rules. </span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c4">How does a lifelong blue-chip employee escape to travel the world for a month without his boss even noticing? He uses technology to hide the fact. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">Gold is getting old. The New Rich (</span><span class="c0">NR</span><span class="c4">) are those who abandon the deferred-life plan and create luxury lifestyles in the present using the currency of the New Rich: time and mobility. This is an art and a science we will refer to as Lifestyle Design (</span><span class="c0">LD</span><span class="c4">). </span></p><p class="c58 c68 c41"><span class="c4">I&rsquo;ve spent the last three years traveling among those who live in worlds currently beyond your imagination. Rather than hating reality, I&rsquo;ll show you how to bend it to your will. It&rsquo;s easier than it sounds. My journey from grossly overworked and severely underpaid office worker to member of the </span><span class="c0">NR </span><span class="c4">is at once stranger than fiction and&mdash; now that I&rsquo;ve deciphered the code&mdash;simple to duplicate. There is a recipe. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">Life doesn&rsquo;t have to be so damn hard. It really doesn&rsquo;t. Most people, my past self included, have spent too much time convincing themselves that life has to be hard, a resignation to 9-to-5 drudgery in exchange for (sometimes) relaxing weekends and the occasional keep-it-short-or-get-fired vacation. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">The truth, at least the truth I live and will share in this book, is quite different. From leveraging currency differences to outsourcing your life and disappearing, I&rsquo;ll show you how a small underground uses economic sleight-of-hand to do what most consider impossible. </span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c4">If you&rsquo;ve picked up this book, chances are that you don&rsquo;t want to sit behind a desk until you are 62. Whether your dream is escaping the rat race, real-life fantasy travel, long-term wandering, setting world records, or simply a dramatic career change, this book will give you all the tools you need to make it a reality in the here-and-now instead of in the often elusive &ldquo;retirement.&rdquo; There is a way to get the rewards for a life of hard work without waiting until the end. </span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c4">How? It begins with a simple distinction most people miss&mdash;one I missed for 25 years. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">People don&rsquo;t want to </span><span class="c17">be </span><span class="c4">millionaires&mdash;they want to experience what they believe only millions can buy. Ski chalets, butlers, and exotic travel often enter the picture. Perhaps rubbing cocoa butter on your belly in a hammock while you listen to waves rhythmically lapping against the deck of your thatched-roof bungalow? Sounds nice. </span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c4">$1,000,000 in the bank isn&rsquo;t the fantasy. The fantasy is the lifestyle of complete freedom it supposedly allows. The question is then, </span><span class="c17">How can one achieve the millionaire lifestyle of complete freedom without first having $1,000,000? </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">In the last five years, I have answered this question for myself, and this book will answer it for you. I will show you exactly how I have separated income from time and created my ideal lifestyle in the process, traveling the world and enjoying the best this planet has to offer. How on earth did I go from 14-hour days and $40,000 per year to 4-hour weeks and $40,000-plus per month? </span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c4">It helps to know where it all started. Strangely enough, it was in a class of soon-to- be investment bankers. </span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c4">In 2002, I was asked by Ed Zschau, &uuml;bermentor and my former professor of High- tech Entrepreneurship at Princeton University, to come back and speak to the same class about my business adventures in the real world. I was stuck. There were already decamillionaires speaking to the same class, and even though I had built a highly profitable sports supplement company, I marched to a distinctly different drummer. </span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c4">Over the ensuing days, however, I realized that everyone seemed to be discussing how to build large and successful companies, sell out, and live the good life. Fair enough. The question no one really seemed to be asking or answering was, Why do it </span></p><p class="c32 c68"><span class="c4">all in the first place? What is the pot of gold that justifies spending the best years of your life hoping for happiness in the last? </span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c4">The lectures I ultimately developed, titled &ldquo;Drug Dealing for Fun and Profit,&rdquo; began with a simple premise: Test the most basic assumptions of the work-life equation. </span></p><p class="c145 c185"><span class="c15">&bull; </span></p><p class="c32 c188"><span class="c2">How do your decisions change if retirement isn&rsquo;t an option? </span></p><p class="c97"><span class="c15">&bull; </span></p><p class="c58 c150"><span class="c2">What if you could use a mini-retirement to sample your deferred-life plan reward before working 40 years for it? </span></p><p class="c97"><span class="c15">&bull; </span></p><p class="c32 c188"><span class="c2">Is it really necessary to work like a slave to live like a millionaire? </span></p><p class="c62"><span class="c4">Little did I know where questions like these would take me. </span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c4">The uncommon conclusion? The commonsense rules of the &ldquo;real world&rdquo; are a fragile collection of socially reinforced illusions. This book will teach you how to see and seize the options others do not. What makes this book different? First, I&rsquo;m not going to spend much time on the problem. I&rsquo;m going to assume you are suffering from time famine, creeping dread, or&mdash;worst case&mdash;a tolerable and comfortable existence doing something unfulfilling. The last is most common and most insidious. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">Second, this book is not about saving and will not recommend you abandon your daily glass of red wine for a million dollars 50 years from now. I&rsquo;d rather have the wine. I won&rsquo;t ask you to choose between enjoyment today or money later. I believe you can have both now. The goal is fun </span><span class="c17">and </span><span class="c4">profit. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">Third, this book is not about finding your &ldquo;dream job.&rdquo; I will take as a given that, for most people, somewhere between six and seven billion of them, the perfect job is the one that takes the least time. The vast majority of people will never find a job that can be an unending source of fulfillment, so that is not the goal here; to free time and automate income is. </span></p><p class="c71 c43"><span class="c4">I </span><span class="c3">OPEN EACH </span><span class="c4">class with an explanation of the singular importance of being a &ldquo;dealmaker.&rdquo; The manifesto of the dealmaker is simple: Reality is negotiable. Outside of science and law, all rules can be bent or broken, and it doesn&rsquo;t require being unethical. </span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c4">The </span><span class="c0">DEAL </span><span class="c4">of deal making is also an acronym for the process of becoming a member of the New Rich. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c4">The steps and strategies can be used with incredible results&mdash;whether you are an employee or an entrepreneur. Can you do everything I&rsquo;ve done with a boss? No. Can you use the same principles to double your income, cut your hours in half, or at least double the usual vacation time? Most definitely. </span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c4">Here is the step-by-step process you&rsquo;ll use to reinvent yourself: </span><span class="c0">D for Definition </span><span class="c4">turns misguided common sense upside down and introduces the rules and objectives of the new game. It replaces self-defeating assumptions and explains concepts such as relative wealth and eustress.</span><span class="c9">1 </span><span class="c4">Who are the </span><span class="c0">NR </span><span class="c4">and how do they operate? This section explains the overall lifestyle design recipe&mdash;the fundamentals&mdash;before we add the three ingredients. </span></p><p class="c68 c104"><span class="c0">E for Elimination </span><span class="c4">kills the obsolete notion of time management once and for all. It shows exactly how I used the words of an often-forgotten Italian economist to turn 12- hour days into two-hour days ... in 48 hours. Increase your per-hour results ten times or more with counterintuitive </span><span class="c0">NR </span><span class="c4">techniques for cultivating selective ignorance, developing a low-information diet, and otherwise ignoring the unimportant. This section provides the first of the three luxury lifestyle design ingredients: time. </span></p><p class="c104 c68"><span class="c4">A </span><span class="c0">for Automation </span><span class="c4">puts cash flow on autopilot using geographic arbitrage, outsourcing, and rules of nondecision. From bracketing to the routines of ultrasuccessful </span><span class="c0">NR</span><span class="c4">, it&rsquo;s all here. This section provides the second ingredient of luxury lifestyle design: income. </span></p><p class="c104 c68"><span class="c4">L </span><span class="c0">for Liberation </span><span class="c4">is the mobile manifesto for the globally inclined. The concept of mini-retirements is introduced, as are the means for flawless remote control and escaping the boss. Liberation is not about cheap travel; it is about forever breaking the bonds that confine you to a single location. This section delivers the third and final ingredient for luxury lifestyle design: mobility. </span></p><p class="c71 c68 c352"><span class="c4">I should note that most bosses are less than pleased if you spend one hour in the office each day, and employees should therefore read the steps in the entrepreneurially minded </span><span class="c0">DEAL </span><span class="c4">order but implement them as </span><span class="c0">DELA</span><span class="c4">. If you decide to remain in your current job, it is necessary to create freedom of location before you cut your work hours by 80%. Even if you have never considered becoming an entrepreneur in the modern sense, the </span><span class="c0">DEAL </span><span class="c4">process will turn you into an entrepreneur in the purer sense as first coined by French economist J. B. Say in 1800&mdash;one who shifts economic resources out of an area of lower and into an area of higher yield. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">Last but not least, much of what I recommend will seem impossible and even offensive to basic common sense&mdash;I expect that. Resolve now to test the concepts as an exercise in lateral thinking. If you try it, you&rsquo;ll see just how deep the rabbit hole goes, and you won&rsquo;t ever go back. </span></p><p class="c78 c43 c41"><span class="c4">Take a deep breath and let me show you my world. And remember&mdash;</span><span class="c17">tranquilo</span><span class="c4">.

I survive instead and grow so fat that I can&rsquo;t roll onto my stomach. A muscular imbalance of the eyes makes me look in opposite directions, and my mother refers to me affectionately as &ldquo;tuna fish.&rdquo; So far so good. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">1983 </span><span class="c4">Nearly fail kindergarten because I refuse to learn the alphabet. My teacher refuses to explain why I should learn it, opting instead for &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the teacher&mdash;that&rsquo;s why.&rdquo; I tell her that&rsquo;s stupid and ask her to leave me alone so I can focus on drawing sharks. She sends me to the &ldquo;bad table&rdquo; instead and makes me eat a bar of soap. Disdain for authority begins. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c0">1991 </span><span class="c4">My first job. Ah, the memories. I&rsquo;m hired for minimum wage as the cleaner at an ice cream parlor and quickly realize that the big boss&rsquo;s methods duplicate effort. I do it my way, finish in one hour instead of eight, and spend the rest of the time reading kung-fu magazines and practicing karate kicks outside. I am fired in a record three days, left with the parting comment, &ldquo;Maybe someday you&rsquo;ll understand the value of hard work.&rdquo; It seems I still don&rsquo;t. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c0">1993 </span><span class="c4">I volunteer for a one-year exchange program in Japan, where people work themselves to death&mdash;a phenomenon called </span><span class="c17">karooshi</span><span class="c4">&mdash;and are said to want to be Shinto when born, Christian when married, and Buddhist when they die. I conclude that most people are really confused about life. One evening, intending to ask my host mother to wake me the next morning </span><span class="c17">(okosu)</span><span class="c4">, I ask her to violently rape me </span><span class="c17">(okasu)</span><span class="c4">. She is very confused. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">1996 </span><span class="c4">I manage to slip undetected into Princeton, despite SAT scores 40% lower than the average and my high school admissions counselor telling me to be more &ldquo;realistic.&rdquo; I conclude I&rsquo;m just not good at reality. I major in neuroscience and then switch to East Asian studies to avoid putting printer jacks on cat heads. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c0">1997 </span><span class="c4">Millionaire time! I create an audiobook called </span><span class="c17">How I Beat the Ivy League</span><span class="c4">, use all my money from three summer jobs to manufacture 500 tapes, and proceed to sell exactly none. I will allow my mother to throw them out only in 2006, just nine years of denial later. Such is the joy of baseless overconfidence. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">1998 </span><span class="c4">After four shot-putters kick a friend&rsquo;s head in, I quit bouncing, the highest- paying job on campus, and develop a speed-reading seminar. I plaster campus with hundreds of god-awful neon green flyers that read, &ldquo;triple your reading speed in 3 hours</span><span class="c3">!</span><span class="c4">&rdquo; and prototypical Princeton students proceed to write &ldquo;bullsh*t&rdquo; on every </span></p><p class="c58 c68"><span class="c4">single one. I sell 32 spots at $50 each for the 3-hour event, and $533 per hour convinces me that finding a market before designing a product is smarter than the reverse. Two months later, I&rsquo;m bored to tears of speed-reading and close up shop. I hate services and need a product to ship. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c0">Fall 1998 </span><span class="c4">A huge thesis dispute and the acute fear of becoming an investment banker drive me to commit academic suicide and inform the registrar that I am quitting school until further notice. My dad is convinced that I&rsquo;ll never go back, and I&rsquo;m convinced that my life is over. My mom thinks it&rsquo;s no big deal and that there is no need to be a drama queen. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Spring 1999 </span><span class="c4">In three months, I accept and quit jobs as a curriculum designer at Berlitz, the world&rsquo;s largest publisher of foreign-language materials, and as an analyst at a three-person political asylum research firm. Naturally, I then fly to Taiwan to create a gym chain out of thin air and get shut down by Triads, Chinese mafia. I return to the U.S. defeated and decide to learn kickboxing, winning the national championship four weeks later with the ugliest and most unorthodox style ever witnessed. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Fall 2000 </span><span class="c4">Confidence restored and thesis completely undone, I return to Princeton. My life does not end, and it seems the yearlong delay has worked out in my favor. Twenty-somethings now have David Koresh&ndash;like abilities. My friend sells a company for $450 million, and I decide to head west to sunny California to make my billions. Despite the hottest job market in the history of the world, I manage to go jobless until three months after graduation, when I pull out my trump card and send one start-up CEO 32 consecutive e-mails. He finally gives in and puts me in sales. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c0">Spring 2001 </span><span class="c4">TrueSAN Networks has gone from a 15-person nobody to the &ldquo;number one privately held data storage company&rdquo; (how is that measured?) with 150 employees (what are they all doing?). I am ordered by a newly appointed sales director to &ldquo;start with A&rdquo; in the phone book and dial for dollars. I ask him in the most tactful way possible why we are doing it like retards. He says, &ldquo;Because I say so.&rdquo; Not a good start. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Fall 2001 </span><span class="c4">After a year of 12-hour days, I find out that I&rsquo;m the second-lowest-paid person in the company aside from the receptionist. I resort to aggressively surfing the web full-time. One afternoon, having run out of obscene video clips to forward, I investigate how hard it would be to start a sports nutrition company. Turns out that you can outsource everything from manufacturing to ad design. Two weeks and $5,000 of credit card debt later, I have my first batch in production and a live website. Good thing, too, as I&rsquo;m fired exactly one week later. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c0">2002&ndash;2003 </span><span class="c4">BrainQUICKEN LLC has taken off, and I&rsquo;m now making more than $40K per month instead of $40K per year. The only problem is that I hate life and now work 12-hour-plus days 7 days a week. Kinda painted myself into a corner. I take a one-week &ldquo;vacation&rdquo; to Florence, Italy, with my family and spend 10 hours a day in an Internet caf&eacute; freaking out. Sh*t balls. I begin teaching Princeton students how to build &ldquo;successful&rdquo; (i.e., profitable) companies. </span></p><p class="c78 c43 c41"><span class="c0">Winter 2004 </span><span class="c4">The impossible happens and I&rsquo;m approached by an infomercial production company and an Israeli conglomerate (huh?) interested in buying my baby </span></p><p class="c58 c68"><span class="c4">BrainQUICKEN. I simplify, eliminate, and otherwise clean house to make myself expendable. Miraculously, BQ doesn&rsquo;t fall apart, but both deals do. Back to Groundhog Day. Soon thereafter, both companies attempt to replicate my product and lose millions of dollars. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">June 2004 </span><span class="c4">I decide that, even if my company implodes, I need to escape before I go Howard Hughes. I turn everything upside down and&mdash;backpack in hand&mdash;go to JFK Airport in New York City, buying the first one-way ticket to Europe I can find. I land in London and intend to continue on to Spain for four weeks of recharging my batteries before returning to the salt mines. I start my relaxation by promptly having a nervous breakdown the first morning. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c0">July 2004&ndash;2005 </span><span class="c4">Four weeks turn into eight, and I decide to stay overseas indefinitely for a final exam in automation and experimental living, limiting e-mail to one hour each Monday morning. As soon as I remove myself as a bottleneck, profits increase 40%. What on earth do you do when you no longer have work as an excuse to be hyperactive and avoid the big questions? Be terrified and hold on to your ass with both hands, apparently. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c0">September 2006 </span><span class="c4">I return to the U.S. in an odd, Zen-like state after methodically destroying all of my assumptions about what can and cannot be done. &ldquo;Drug Dealing for Fun and Profit&rdquo; has evolved into a class on ideal lifestyle design.

Being financially rich and having the ability to live like a millionaire are fundamentally two very different things. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">Money is multiplied in practical value depending on the number of W&rsquo;s you control in your life: </span><span class="c0">what </span><span class="c4">you do, </span><span class="c0">when </span><span class="c4">you do it, </span><span class="c0">where </span><span class="c4">you do it, and with </span><span class="c0">whom </span><span class="c4">you do it.

Dale Begg-Smith executed the backflip perfectly&mdash;skis crossed in an X over his head&mdash;and landed in the record books as he slid across the finish. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">It was February 16, 2006, and he was now a mogul-skiing gold medalist at the Turin Winter Olympics. Unlike other full-time athletes, he will never have to return to a dead-end job after his moment of glory, nor will he look back at this day as the climax of his only passion. After all, he was only 21 years old and drove a black Lamborghini. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">Born a Canadian and something of a late bloomer, Dale found his calling, an Internet-based IT company, at the age of 13. Fortunately, he had a more-experienced mentor and partner to guide him: his 15-year-old brother, Jason. Created to fund their dreams of standing atop the Olympic podium, it would, only two years later, become the third-largest company of its kind in the world. </span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c4">While Dale&rsquo;s teammates were hitting the slopes for extra sessions, he was often buying sake for clients in Tokyo. In a world of &ldquo;work harder, not smarter,&rdquo; it came to pass that his coaches felt he was spending too much time on his business and not enough time in training, despite his results. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">Rather than choose between his business or his dream, Dale chose to move laterally with both, from either/or to both/and. He wasn&rsquo;t spending too much time on his business; he and his brother were spending too much time with Canucks. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">In 2002, they moved to the ski capital of the world, Australia, where the team was smaller, more flexible, and coached by a legend. Three short years later, he received citizenship, went head-to-head against former teammates, and became the third &ldquo;Aussie&rdquo; in history to win winter gold. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">In the land of wallabies and big surf, Dale has since gone postal. Literally.

KENNEDY </span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c6">S</span><span class="c4">ome people remain convinced that just a bit more money will make things right. Their goals are arbitrary moving targets: $300,000 in the bank, $1,000,000 in the portfolio, $100,000 a year instead of $50,000, etc. Julie&rsquo;s goal made intrinsic sense: come back with the same number of children she had left with. </span></p><p class="c58 c68 c41"><span class="c4">She reclined in her seat and glanced across the aisle past her sleeping husband, Marc, counting as she had done thousands of times&mdash;one, two, three. So far so good. In 12 hours, they would all be back in Paris, safe and sound. That was assuming the plane from New Caledonia held together, of course. </span></p><p class="c38"><span class="c4">New Caledonia? Nestled in the tropics of the Coral Sea, New Caledonia was a French territory and where Julie and Marc had just sold the sailboat that took them 15,000 miles around the world. Of course, recouping their initial investment had been part of the plan. All said and done, their 15-month exploration of the globe, from the gondola-rich waterways of Venice to the tribal shores of Polynesia, had cost between $18,000 and $19,000. Less than rent and baguettes in Paris. </span></p><p class="c78 c43 c41"><span class="c4">Most people would consider this impossible. Then again, most people don&rsquo;t know that more than 300 families set sail from France each year to do the same. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">The trip had been a dream for almost two decades, relegated to the back of the line behind an ever-growing list of responsibilities. Each passing moment brought a new list of reasons for putting it off. One day, Julie realized that if she didn&rsquo;t do it now, she would never do it. The rationalizations, legitimate or not, would just continue to add up and make it harder to convince herself that escape was possible. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">One year of preparation and one 30-day trial run with her husband later, they set sail on the trip of a lifetime. Julie realized almost as soon as the anchor lifted that, far from being a reason not to travel and seek adventure, children are perhaps the best reason of all to do both. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">Pre-trip, her three little boys had fought like banshees at the drop of a hat. In the process of learning to coexist in a floating bedroom, they learned patience, as much for themselves as for the sanity of their parents. Pre-trip, books were about as appealing as eating sand. Given the alternative of staring at a wall on the open sea, all three learned to love books. Pulling them out of school for one academic year and exposing them to new environments had proven to be the best investment in their education to date. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">Now sitting in the plane, Julie looked out at the clouds as the wing cut past them, already thinking of their next plans: to find a place in the mountains and ski all year long, using income from a sail-rigging workshop to fund the slopes and more travel. </span></p><p class="c82 c161"><span class="c4">Now that she had done it once, she had the itch. </span></p><p class="c105 c154"><span class="c0">LIFESTYLE DESIGN IN ACTION </span></p><p class="c118 c43 c41"><span class="c4">I was done with driving across town to collect my son from child- care only to slide across icy highways trying to get back to work with him in tow to finish my work.

God forbid. That seemed a bit dangerous, considering I did it on a dare and had four weeks of preparation. Besides, I have a watermelon head&mdash;it&rsquo;s a big target. </span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c4">I won by reading the rules and looking for unexploited opportunities, of which there were two: </span></p><p class="c56 c68"><span class="c0">1. Weigh-ins were the day prior to competition: </span><span class="c4">Using dehydration techniques commonly practiced by elite powerlifters and Olympic wrestlers, I lost 28 pounds in 18 hours, weighed in at 165 pounds, and then hyperhydrated back to 193 pounds.</span><span class="c9">2 </span><span class="c4">It&rsquo;s hard to fight someone from three weight classes above you. Poor little guys. </span><span class="c0">2. There was a technicality in the fine print: </span><span class="c4">If one combatant fell off the elevated platform three times in a single round, his opponent won by default. I decided to use this technicality as my principal technique and push people off. As you might imagine, this did not make the judges the happiest Chinese I&rsquo;ve ever seen. </span></p><p class="c74 c43 c41"><span class="c4">The result? I won all of my matches by technical knock-out (TKO) and went home national champion, something 99% of those with 5&ndash;10 years of experience had been unable to do. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">But, isn&rsquo;t pushing people out of the ring pushing the boundaries of ethics? Not at all&mdash;it&rsquo;s no more than doing the uncommon within the rules. The important distinction is that between official rules and self-imposed rules. Consider the following example, from the official website of the Olympic movement (</span><span class="c7">www.olympic.org</span><span class="c4">). </span></p><p class="c118 c68"><span class="c4">The 1968 Mexico City Olympics marked the international debut of Dick Fosbury and his celebrated &ldquo;Fosbury flop,&rdquo; which would soon revolutionize high-jumping. At the time, jumpers... swung their outside foot up and over the bar [called the &ldquo;straddle,&rdquo; much like a hurdle jump, it allowed you to land on your feet]. Fosbury&rsquo;s technique began by racing up to the bar at great speed and taking off from his right (or outside) foot. Then he twisted his body so that he went over the bar head-first with his back to the bar. While the coaches of the world shook their heads in disbelief, the Mexico City audience was absolutely captivated by Fosbury and shouted, &ldquo;Ol&eacute;!&rdquo; as he cleared the bar. Fosbury cleared every height through 2.22 metres without a miss and then achieved a personal record of 2.24 metres to win the gold medal. </span></p><p class="c78 c203"><span class="c4">By 1980, 13 of the 16 Olympic finalists were using the Fosbury flop. </span></p><p class="c71 c43 c41"><span class="c4">The weight-cutting techniques and off-platform throwing I used are now standard features of Sanshou competition. I didn&rsquo;t cause it, I just foresaw it as inevitable, as did others who tested this superior approach. Now it&rsquo;s par for the course. </span></p><p class="c82 c164"><span class="c4">Sports evolve when sacred cows are killed, when basic assumptions are tested. The same is true in life and in lifestyles. </span></p><p class="c32 c153"><span class="c13">Challenging the Status Quo vs. Being Stupid </span></p><p class="c233 c43"><span class="c6">M</span><span class="c4">ost people walk down the street on their legs. Does that mean I walk down the street on my hands? Do I wear my underwear outside of my pants in the name of being different? Not usually, no. Then again, walking on my legs and keeping my thong on the inside have worked just fine thus far. I don&rsquo;t fix it if it isn&rsquo;t broken. </span></p><p class="c57"><span class="c4">Different is better when it is more effective or more fun. If everyone is defining a problem or solving it one way and the results are subpar, this is the time to ask, What if I did the opposite? Don&rsquo;t follow a model that doesn&rsquo;t work. If the recipe sucks, it doesn&rsquo;t matter how good a cook you are. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">When I was in data storage sales, my first gig out of college, I realized that most cold calls didn&rsquo;t get to the intended person for one reason: gatekeepers. If I simply made all my calls from 8:00&ndash;8:30 </span><span class="c3">A.M. </span><span class="c4">and 6:00&ndash;6:30 </span><span class="c3">P.M., </span><span class="c4">for a total of one hour, I was able to avoid secretaries and book more than twice as many meetings as the senior sales executives who called from 9&ndash;5. In other words, I got twice the results for 1/8 the time. </span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c4">From Japan to Monaco, from globetrotting single mothers to multimillionaire racecar drivers, the basic rules of successful </span><span class="c0">NR </span><span class="c4">are surprisingly uniform and predictably divergent from what the rest of the world is doing. </span></p><p class="c78 c43 c41"><span class="c4">The following rules are the fundamental differentiators to keep in mind throughout this book. </span></p><p class="c48 c43"><span class="c0">1. Retirement Is Worst-Case-Scenario Insurance</span><span class="c4">. Retirement planning is like life insurance. It should be viewed as nothing more than a hedge against the absolute worst-case scenario: in this case, becoming physically incapable of working and needing a reservoir of capital to survive. </span></p><p class="c82 c355"><span class="c4">Retirement as a goal or final redemption is flawed for at least three solid reasons: </span></p><p class="c138"><span class="c4">1. It is predicated on the assumption that you dislike what you are doing during the most physically capable years of your life. This is a nonstarter&mdash; nothing can justify that sacrifice. </span></p><p class="c31"><span class="c4">2. Most people will never be able to retire and maintain even a hotdogs-for- dinner standard of living. Even one million is chump change in a world where traditional retirement could span 30 years and inflation lowers your purchasing power 2&ndash;4% per year. The math doesn&rsquo;t work.</span><span class="c9">3</span><span class="c4">The golden years become lower-middle-class life revisited. That&rsquo;s a bittersweet ending. </span></p><p class="c31"><span class="c4">3. If the math does work, it means that you are one ambitious, hardworking machine. If that&rsquo;s the case, guess what? One week into retirement, you&rsquo;ll be so damn bored that you&rsquo;ll want to stick bicycle spokes in your eyes. You&rsquo;ll probably opt to look for a new job or start another company. Kinda defeats the purpose of waiting, doesn&rsquo;t it? </span></p><p class="c32 c43 c41"><span class="c4">I&rsquo;m not saying don&rsquo;t plan for the worst case&mdash;I have maxed out 401(k)s and IRAs I use primarily for tax purposes&mdash;but don&rsquo;t mistake retirement for the goal. </span></p><p class="c40"><span class="c0">2. Interest and Energy Are Cyclical</span><span class="c4">. If I offered you $10,000,000 to work 24 hours a day for 15 years and then retire, would you do it? Of course not&mdash;you couldn&rsquo;t. It is unsustainable, just as what most define as a career: doing the same thing for 8+ hours per day until you break down or have enough cash to permanently stop. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">How else can my 30-year-old friends all look like a cross between Donald Trump and Joan Rivers? It&rsquo;s horrendous&mdash;premature aging fueled by triple bypass frappuccinos and impossible workloads. </span></p><p class="c38 c41"><span class="c4">Alternating periods of activity and rest is necessary to survive, let alone thrive. Capacity, interest, and mental endurance all wax and wane. Plan accordingly. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">The </span><span class="c0">NR </span><span class="c4">aims to distribute &ldquo;mini-retirements&rdquo; throughout life instead of hoarding the recovery and enjoyment for the fool&rsquo;s gold of retirement. By working only when you are most effective, life is both more productive and more enjoyable. It&rsquo;s the perfect example of having your cake and eating it, too. </span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c4">Personally, I now aim for one month of overseas relocation or high-intensity learning (tango, fighting, whatever) for every two months of work projects. </span></p><p class="c40"><span class="c0">3. Less Is Not Laziness</span><span class="c4">. Doing less meaningless work, so that you can focus on things of greater personal importance, is NOT laziness. This is hard for most to accept, because our culture tends to reward personal sacrifice instead of personal productivity. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">Few people choose to (or are able to) measure the results of their actions and thus measure their contribution in time. More time equals more self-worth and more reinforcement from those above and around them. The </span><span class="c0">NR</span><span class="c4">, despite fewer hours in the office, produce more meaningful results than the next dozen non-</span><span class="c0">NR </span><span class="c4">combined. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">Let&rsquo;s define &ldquo;laziness&rdquo; anew&mdash;to endure a non-ideal existence, to let circumstance or others decide life for you, or to amass a fortune while passing through life like a spectator from an office window. The size of your bank account doesn&rsquo;t change this, nor does the number of hours you log in handling unimportant e-mail or minutiae. </span></p><p class="c82 c236"><span class="c4">Focus on being productive instead of busy. </span></p><p class="c40"><span class="c0">4. The Timing Is Never Right</span><span class="c4">. I once asked my mom how she decided when to have her first child, little ol&rsquo; me. The answer was simple: &ldquo;It was something we wanted, and we decided there was no point in putting it off. The timing is never right to have a baby.&rdquo; And so it is. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">For all of the most important things, the timing always sucks. Waiting for a good time to quit your job? The stars will never align and the traffic lights of life will never all be green at the same time. The universe doesn&rsquo;t conspire against you, but it doesn&rsquo;t </span></p><p class="c58 c68"><span class="c4">go out of its way to line up all the pins either. Conditions are never perfect. &ldquo;Someday&rdquo; is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you. Pro and con lists are just as bad. If it&rsquo;s important to you and you want to do it &ldquo;eventually,&rdquo; just do it and correct course along the way. </span></p><p class="c40"><span class="c0">5. Ask for Forgiveness, Not Permission</span><span class="c4">. If it isn&rsquo;t going to devastate those around you, try it and then justify it. People&mdash; whether parents, partners, or bosses&mdash;deny things on an emotional basis that they can learn to accept after the fact. If the potential damage is moderate or in any way reversible, don&rsquo;t give people the chance to say no. Most people are fast to stop you before you get started but hesitant to get in the way if you&rsquo;re moving. Get good at being a troublemaker and saying sorry when you really screw up. </span></p><p class="c40"><span class="c0">6. Emphasize Strengths, Don&rsquo;t Fix Weaknesses</span><span class="c4">. Most people are good at a handful of things and utterly miserable at most. I am great at product creation and marketing but terrible at most of the things that follow. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">My body is designed to lift heavy objects and throw them, and that&rsquo;s it. I ignored this for a long time. I tried swimming and looked like a drowning monkey. I tried basketball and looked like a caveman. Then I became a fighter and took off. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">It is far more lucrative and fun to leverage your strengths instead of attempting to fix all the chinks in your armor. The choice is between </span><span class="c17">multiplication </span><span class="c4">of results using strengths or </span><span class="c17">incremental </span><span class="c4">improvement fixing weaknesses that will, at best, become mediocre. Focus on better use of your best weapons instead of constant repair. </span></p><p class="c40"><span class="c0">7. Things in Excess Become Their Opposite</span><span class="c4">. It is possible to have too much of a good thing. In excess, most endeavors and possessions take on the characteristics of their opposite. Thus: </span></p><p class="c118 c240"><span class="c4">Pacifists become militants. Freedom fighters become tyrants. Blessings become curses. Help becomes hindrance. More becomes less.</span><span class="c9">4 </span></p><p class="c118 c68"><span class="c4">Too much, too many, and too often of what you want becomes what you don&rsquo;t want. This is true of possessions and even time. Lifestyle Design is thus not interested in creating an excess of idle time, which is poisonous, but the positive use of free time, defined simply as doing what you want as opposed to what you feel obligated to do. </span></p><p class="c141 c68"><span class="c0">8. Money Alone Is Not the Solution</span><span class="c4">. There is much to be said for the power of money as currency (I&rsquo;m a fan myself), but adding more of it just isn&rsquo;t the answer as often as we&rsquo;d like to think. In part, it&rsquo;s laziness. &ldquo;If only I had more money&rdquo; is the easiest way to postpone the intense self- </span></p><p class="c58 c68"><span class="c4">examination and decision-making necessary to create a life of enjoyment&mdash;now and not later. By using money as the scapegoat and work as our all-consuming routine, we are able to conveniently disallow ourselves the time to do otherwise: &ldquo;John, I&rsquo;d love to talk about the gaping void I feel in my life, the hopelessness that hits me like a punch in the eye every time I start my computer in the morning, but I have so much work to do! I&rsquo;ve got at least three hours of unimportant e-mail to reply to before calling the prospects who said &lsquo;no&rsquo; yesterday. Gotta run!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">Busy yourself with the routine of the money wheel, pretend it&rsquo;s the fix-all, and you artfully create a constant distraction that prevents you from seeing just how pointless it is. Deep down, you know it&rsquo;s all an illusion, but with everyone participating in the same game of make-believe, it&rsquo;s easy to forget. </span></p><p class="c82 c178"><span class="c4">The problem is more than money. </span></p><p class="c40"><span class="c0">9. Relative Income Is More Important Than Absolute Income</span><span class="c4">. Among dietitians and nutritionists, there is some debate over the value of a calorie. Is a calorie a calorie, much like a rose is a rose? Is fat loss as simple as expending more calories than you consume, or is the source of those calories important? Based on work with top athletes, I know the answer to be the latter. </span></p><p class="c115 c43"><span class="c4">What about income? Is a dollar is a dollar is a dollar? The New Rich don&rsquo;t think so. Let&rsquo;s look at this like a fifth-grade math problem. Two hardworking chaps are headed toward each other. Chap A moving at 80 hours per week and Chap B moving at 10 hours per week. They both make $50,000 per year. Who will be richer when they pass in the middle of the night? If you said B, you would be correct, and this is the difference between </span><span class="c0">absolute </span><span class="c4">and </span><span class="c0">relative </span><span class="c4">income. </span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c4">Absolute income is measured using one holy and inalterable variable: the raw and almighty dollar. Jane Doe makes $100,000 per year and is thus twice as rich as John Doe, who makes $50,000 per year. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">Relative income uses two variables: the dollar and time, usually hours. The whole &ldquo;per year&rdquo; concept is arbitrary and makes it easy to trick yourself. Let&rsquo;s look at the real trade. Jane Doe makes $100,000 per year, $2,000 for each of 50 weeks per year, and works 80 hours per week. Jane Doe thus makes $25 per hour. John Doe makes $50,000 per year, $1,000 for each of 50 weeks per year, but works 10 hours per week and hence makes $100 per hour. In relative income, John is </span><span class="c17">four times </span><span class="c4">richer. </span></p><p class="c68 c115"><span class="c4">Of course, relative income has to add up to the minimum amount necessary to actualize your goals. If I make $100 per hour but only work one hour per week, it&rsquo;s going to be hard for me to run amuck like a superstar. Assuming that the total absolute income is where it needs to be to live my dreams (not an arbitrary point of comparison with the Joneses), relative income is the real measurement of wealth for the New Rich. The top New Rich mavericks make at least $5,000 per hour. Out of college, I started at about $5. I&rsquo;ll get you closer to the former. </span></p><p class="c141 c264"><span class="c0">10. Distress Is Bad, Eustress Is Good</span><span class="c4">. </span></p><p class="c58 c68"><span class="c4">Unbeknownst to most fun-loving bipeds, not all stress is bad. Indeed, the New Rich don&rsquo;t aim to eliminate all stress. Not in the least. There are two separate types of stress, each as different as euphoria and its seldom-mentioned opposite, </span><span class="c17">dys</span><span class="c4">phoria. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c17">Dis</span><span class="c4">tress refers to harmful stimuli that make you weaker, less confident, and less able. Destructive criticism, abusive bosses, and smashing your face on a curb are examples of this. These are things we want to avoid. </span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c17">Eu</span><span class="c4">stress, on the other hand, is a word most of you have probably never heard. </span><span class="c17">Eu-</span><span class="c4">, a Greek prefix for &ldquo;healthy,&rdquo; is used in the same sense in the word &ldquo;euphoria.&rdquo; Role models who push us to exceed our limits, physical training that removes our spare tires, and risks that expand our sphere of comfortable action are all examples of eustress&mdash;stress that is healthful and the stimulus for growth. </span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c4">People who avoid all criticism fail. It&rsquo;s destructive criticism we need to avoid, not criticism in all forms. Similarly, there is no progress without eustress, and the more eustress we can create or apply to our lives, the sooner we can actualize our dreams. The trick is telling the two apart. </span></p><p class="c82 c98"><span class="c4">The New Rich are equally aggressive in removing distress and finding eustress. </span></p><p class="c105 c135"><span class="c0">Q&amp;A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS </span><span class="c4">1.

Ruuuuuuuuuun!&rdquo; Hans didn&rsquo;t speak Portuguese, but the meaning was clear enough&mdash;haul ass. His sneakers gripped firmly on the jagged rock, and he drove his chest forward toward 3,000 feet of nothing. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">He held his breath on the final step, and the panic drove him to near unconsciousness. His vision blurred at the edges, closing to a single pinpoint of light, and then ... he floated. The all-consuming celestial blue of the horizon hit his visual field an instant after he realized that the thermal updraft had caught him and the wings of the paraglider. Fear was behind him on the mountaintop, and thousands of feet above the resplendent green rain forest and pristine white beaches of Copacabana, Hans Keeling had seen the light. </span></p><p class="c38"><span class="c4">That was Sunday. On Monday, Hans returned to his law office in Century City, Los Angeles&rsquo;s posh corporate haven, and promptly handed in his three-week notice. For nearly five years, he had faced his alarm clock with the same dread: I have to do </span><span class="c17">this </span><span class="c4">for another 40&ndash;45 years? He had once slept under his desk at the office after a punishing half-done project, only to wake up and continue on it the next morning. That same morning, he had made himself a promise: two more times and I&rsquo;m out of here. Strike number three came the day before he left for his Brazilian vacation. </span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c4">We all make these promises to ourselves, and Hans had done it before as well, but things were now somehow different. He was different. He had realized something while arcing in slow circles toward the earth&mdash;risks weren&rsquo;t that scary once you took them. His colleagues told him what he expected to hear: He was throwing it all away. He was an attorney on his way to the top&mdash;what the hell did he want? </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">Hans didn&rsquo;t know exactly what he wanted, but he had tasted it. On the other hand, he did know what bored him to tears, and he was done with it. No more passing days as the living dead, no more dinners where his colleagues compared cars, riding on the sugar high of a new BMW purchase until someone bought a more expensive Mercedes. It was over. </span></p><p class="c38 c41"><span class="c4">Immediately, a strange shift began&mdash;Hans felt, for the first time in a long time, at peace with himself and what he was doing. He had always been terrified of plane </span></p><p class="c32 c68"><span class="c4">turbulence, as if he might die with the best inside of him, but now he could fly through a violent storm sleeping like a baby. Strange indeed. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">More than a year later, he was still getting unsolicited job offers from law firms, but by then had started Nexus Surf,</span><span class="c9">5 </span><span class="c4">a premier surf-adventure company based in the tropical paradise of Florianopolis, Brazil. He had met his dream girl, a Carioca with caramel-colored skin named Tatiana, and spent most of his time relaxing under palm trees or treating clients to the best times of their lives. </span></p><p class="c82 c43"><span class="c4">Is this what he had been so afraid of? These days, he often sees his former self in the underjoyed and overworked professionals he takes out on the waves. Waiting for the swell, the true emotions come out: &ldquo;God, I wish I could do what you do.&rdquo; His reply is always the same: &ldquo;You can.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">The setting sun reflects off the surface of the water, providing a Zen-like setting for a message he knows is true: It&rsquo;s not giving up to put your current path on indefinite pause. He could pick up his law career exactly where he left off if he wanted to, but that is the furthest thing from his mind. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">As they paddle back to shore after an awesome session, his clients get ahold of themselves and regain their composure. They set foot on shore, and reality sinks its fangs in: &ldquo;I would, but I can&rsquo;t really throw it all away.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c82 c186"><span class="c4">He has to laugh. </span></p><p class="c99"><span class="c13">The Power of Pessimism: Defining the Nightmare </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c4">Action may not always bring happiness, but there is no happiness without action. &mdash;</span><span class="c3">BENJAMIN DISRAELI, </span><span class="c4">former British Prime Minister </span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c6">T</span><span class="c4">o door not to do? To try or not to try? Most people will vote no, whether they consider themselves brave or not. Uncertainty and the prospect of failure can be very scary noises in the shadows. Most people will choose unhappiness over uncertainty. For years, I set goals, made resolutions to change direction, and nothing came of either. I was just as insecure and scared as the rest of the world. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">The simple solution came to me accidentally four years ago. At that time, I had more money than I knew what to do with&mdash;I was making $70K or so per month&mdash;and I was completely miserable, worse than ever. I had no time and was working myself to death. I had started my own company, only to realize it would be nearly impossible to sell.</span><span class="c9">6</span><span class="c4">Oops. I felt trapped and stupid at the same time. I should be able to figure this out, I thought. Why am I such an idiot? Why can&rsquo;t I make this work?! Buckle up and stop being such a (insert expletive)! What&rsquo;s wrong with me? The truth was, nothing was wrong with me. I hadn&rsquo;t reached my limit; I&rsquo;d reached the limit of my business model at the time. It wasn&rsquo;t the driver, it was the vehicle. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c4">Critical mistakes in its infancy would never let me sell it. I could hire magic elves and connect my brain to a supercomputer&mdash;it didn&rsquo;t matter. My little baby had some serious birth defects. The question then became, How do I free myself from this Frankenstein while making it self-sustaining? How do I pry myself from the tentacles of workaholism and the fear that it would fall to pieces without my 15-hour days? How do I escape this self-made prison? A trip, I decided. A sabbatical year around the world. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">So I took the trip, right? Well, I&rsquo;ll get to that. First, I felt it prudent to dance around with my shame, embarrassment, and anger for six months, all the while playing an endless loop of reasons why my cop-out fantasy trip could never work. One of my more productive periods, for sure. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">Then, one day, in my bliss of envisioning how bad my future suffering would be, I hit upon a gem of an idea. It was surely a highlight of my &ldquo;don&rsquo;t happy, be worry&rdquo; phase: Why don&rsquo;t I decide exactly what my nightmare would be&mdash;the worst thing that could possibly happen as a result of my trip? </span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c4">Well, my business could fail while I&rsquo;m overseas, for sure. Probably would. A legal warning letter would accidentally not get forwarded and I would get sued. My business would be shut down, and inventory would spoil on the shelves while I&rsquo;m picking my toes in solitary misery on some cold shore in Ireland. Crying in the rain, I imagine. My bank account would crater by 80% and certainly my car and motorcycle in storage would be stolen. I suppose someone would probably spit on my head from a high-rise balcony while I&rsquo;m feeding food scraps to a stray dog, which would then spook and bite me squarely on the face. God, life is a cruel, hard bitch. </span></p><p class="c241"><span class="c13">Conquering Fear = Defining Fear </span></p><p class="c65 c312"><span class="c4">Set aside a certain number of days, during which you shall be content with the scantiest and cheapest fare, with course and rough dress, saying to yourself the while: &ldquo;Is this the condition that I feared?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c82 c86"><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c3">SENECA </span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c6">T</span><span class="c4">hen a funny thing happened. In my undying quest to make myself miserable, I accidentally began to backpedal. As soon as I cut through the vague unease and ambiguous anxiety by defining my nightmare, the worst-case scenario, I wasn&rsquo;t as worried about taking a trip. Suddenly, I started thinking of simple steps I could take to salvage my remaining resources and get back on track if all hell struck at once. I could always take a temporary bartending job to pay the rent if I had to. I could sell some furniture and cut back on eating out. I could steal lunch money from the kindergarteners who passed by my apartment every morning. The options were many. I realized it wouldn&rsquo;t be that hard to get back to where I was, let alone survive. None </span></p><p class="c58 c68"><span class="c4">of these things would be fatal&mdash;not even close. Mere panty pinches on the journey of life. </span><span class="c45">I realized that on a scale of 1&ndash;10, 1 being nothing and 10 being permanently life- </span><span class="c4">changing, my so-called worst-case scenario might have a </span><span class="c17">temporary </span><span class="c4">impact of 3 or 4. I believe this is true of most people and most would-be &ldquo;holy sh*t, my life is over&rdquo; disasters. Keep in mind that this is the one-in-a-million disaster nightmare. On the other hand, if I realized my best-case scenario, or even a probable-case scenario, it would easily have a </span><span class="c17">permanent </span><span class="c4">9 or 10 positive life-changing effect. </span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c4">In other words, I was risking an unlikely and temporary 3 or 4 for a probable and permanent 9 or 10, and I could easily recover my baseline workaholic prison with a bit of extra work if I wanted to. This all equated to a significant realization: There was practically no risk, only huge life-changing upside potential, and I could resume my previous course without any more effort than I was already putting forth. </span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c4">That is when I made the decision to take the trip and bought a one-way ticket to Europe. I started planning my adventures and eliminating my physical and psychological baggage. None of my disasters came to pass, and my life has been a near fairy tale since. The business did better than ever, and I practically forgot about it as it financed my travels around the world in style for 15 months. </span></p><p class="c254"><span class="c13">Uncovering Fear Disguised as Optimism </span></p><p class="c146 c65"><span class="c4">There&rsquo;s no difference between a pessimist who says, &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s hopeless, so don&rsquo;t bother doing anything,&rdquo; and an optimist who says, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother doing anything, it&rsquo;s going to turn out fine anyway.&rdquo; Either way, nothing happens. &mdash;</span><span class="c3">YVON CHOUINARD</span><span class="c4">,</span><span class="c9">7 </span><span class="c4">founder of Patagonia </span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c6">F</span><span class="c4">ear comes in many forms, and we usually don&rsquo;t call it by its four-letter name. Fear itself is quite fear-inducing. Most intelligent people in the world dress it up as something else: optimistic denial. Most who avoid quitting their jobs entertain the thought that their course will improve with time or increases in income. This seems valid and is a tempting hallucination when a job is boring or uninspiring instead of pure hell. Pure hell forces action, but anything less can be endured with enough clever rationalization. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">Do you really think it will improve or is it wishful thinking and an excuse for inaction? If you were confident in improvement, would you really be questioning things so? Generally not. This is fear of the unknown disguised as optimism. </span></p><p class="c43 c82"><span class="c4">Are you better off than you were one year ago, one month ago, or one week ago? If not, things will not improve by themselves. If you are kidding yourself, it is time to stop and plan for a jump. Barring any James Dean ending, your life is going to be LONG.

In that sense, his timing was great. He arrived in Ghana in the early 1980s, in the middle of a coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat, at the peak of hyperinflation, and just in time for the worst drought in a decade. For these same reasons, some people would consider his timing quite poor from a more selfish survival standpoint. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">He had also missed the memo. The national menu had changed, and they were out of luxuries like bread and clean water. He would be surviving for four months on a slushlike concoction of corn meal and spinach. Not what most of us would order at the movie theater. </span></p><p class="c48 c190"><span class="c4">&ldquo;WOW, I CAN SURVIVE.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c6">J</span><span class="c4">ean-Marc had passed the point of no return, but it didn&rsquo;t matter. After two weeks of adjusting to the breakfast, lunch, and dinner (Mush &agrave; la Ghana), he had no desire to escape. The most basic of foods and good friends proved to be the only real necessities, and what would seem like a disaster from the outside was the most life- affirming epiphany he&rsquo;d ever experienced: The worst really wasn&rsquo;t that bad. To enjoy life, you don&rsquo;t need fancy nonsense, but you do need to control your time and realize that most things just aren&rsquo;t as serious as you make them out to be. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">Now 48, Jean-Marc lives in a nice home in Ontario, but could live without it. He has cash, but could fall into poverty tomorrow and it wouldn&rsquo;t matter. Some of his fondest memories still include nothing but friends and gruel. He is dedicated to creating special moments for himself and his family and is utterly unconcerned with retirement. He&rsquo;s already lived 20 years of partial retirement in perfect health. </span></p><p class="c78 c101"><span class="c4">Don&rsquo;t save it all for the end.

What doubt, fears, and &ldquo;what-ifs&rdquo; pop up as you consider the big changes you can&mdash;or need&mdash;to make? Envision them in painstaking detail. Would it be the end of your life? What would be the permanent impact, if any, on a scale of 1</span><span class="c3">&ndash;</span><span class="c4">10</span><span class="c3">? </span><span class="c4">Are these things really permanent? How likely do you think it is that they would actually happen? </span></p><p class="c31"><span class="c4">2. </span><span class="c0">What steps could you take to repair the damage or get things back on the upswing, even if temporarily? </span><span class="c4">Chances are, it&rsquo;s easier than you imagine.

What would the impact of these more-likely outcomes be on a scale of 1</span><span class="c3">&ndash;</span><span class="c4">10</span><span class="c3">? </span><span class="c4">How likely is it that you could produce at least a moderately good outcome?

That phone call, that conversation, whatever the action might be&mdash;it is fear of unknown outcomes that prevents us from doing what we need to do. Define the worst case, accept it, and do it. I&rsquo;ll repeat something you might consider tattooing on your forehead: </span><span class="c17">What we fear doing most is usually what we most need to do</span><span class="c4">. As I have heard said, a person&rsquo;s success in life can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations he or she is willing to have. Resolve to do one thing every day that you fear. I got into this habit by attempting to contact celebrities and famous businesspeople for advice. </span></p><p class="c58 c180"><span class="c4">6. </span><span class="c0">What is it costing you&mdash;financially, emotionally, and physically&mdash;to postpone action? </span><span class="c4">Don&rsquo;t only evaluate the potential downside of action. It is equally important to measure the atrocious cost of inaction. If you don&rsquo;t pursue those things that excite you, where will you be in one year, five years, and ten years? How will you feel having allowed circumstance to impose itself upon you and having allowed ten more years of your finite life to pass doing what you know will not fulfill you? If you telescope out 10 years and know with 100% certainty that it is a path of disappointment and regret, and if we define risk as &ldquo;the likelihood of an irreversible negative outcome,&rdquo; inaction is the greatest risk of all. </span></p><p class="c122 c180"><span class="c4">7. </span><span class="c0">What are you waiting for? </span><span class="c4">If you cannot answer this without resorting to the previously rejected concept of good timing, the answer is simple: You&rsquo;re afraid, just like the rest of the world. Measure the cost of inaction, realize the unlikelihood and re-pairability of most missteps, and develop the most important habit of those who excel and enjoy doing so: action. </span></p><p class="c141 c77"><span class="c7">5</span><span class="c4">. </span><span class="c7">www.nexussurf.com 6</span><span class="c4">.

It was simplicity itself: Contact three seemingly impossible-to- reach people&mdash;J.Lo, Bill Clinton, J. D. Salinger, I don&rsquo;t care&mdash;and get at least one to reply to three questions. </span></p><p class="c78 c43 c41"><span class="c4">Of 20 students, all frothing at the mouth to win a free spin across the globe, how many completed the challenge? </span></p><p class="c38"><span class="c4">Exactly ... none. Not a one. There were many excuses: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that easy to get someone to ...&rdquo; &ldquo;I have a big paper due, and ...&rdquo; &ldquo;I would love to, but there&rsquo;s no way I can....&rdquo; There was but one real reason, however, repeated over and over again in different words: It was a difficult challenge, perhaps impossible, and the other students would outdo them. Since all of them overestimated the competition, no one even showed up. </span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c4">According to the rules I had set, if someone had sent me no more than an illegible one-paragraph response, I would have been obligated to give them the prize. This result both fascinated and depressed me. </span></p><p class="c78 c43"><span class="c4">The following year, the outcome was quite different. I told the above cautionary tale and 6 out of 17 finished the challenge in less than 48 hours. Was the second class better? No. In fact, there were more capable students in the first class, but they did nothing. Firepower up the wazoo and no trigger finger. </span></p><p class="c82 c85"><span class="c4">The second group just embraced what I told them before they started, which was ... </span></p><p class="c213"><span class="c13">Doing the Unrealistic Is Easier Than Doing the Realistic </span></p><p class="c43 c227"><span class="c6">F</span><span class="c4">rom contacting billionaires to rubbing elbows with celebrities&mdash;the second group of students did both&mdash;it&rsquo;s as easy as believing it can be done. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">It&rsquo;s lonely at the top. Ninety-nine percent of people in the world are convinced they are incapable of achieving great things, so they aim for the mediocre. The level of competition is thus fiercest for &ldquo;realistic&rdquo; goals, paradoxically making them the most time-and energy-consuming. It is easier to raise $1,000,000 than it is $100,000. It is easier to pick up the one perfect 10 in the bar than the five 8s. </span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c4">If you are insecure, guess what? The rest of the world is, too. Do not overestimate the competition and underestimate yourself. You are better than you think. </span></p><p class="c57"><span class="c4">Unreasonable and unrealistic goals are easier to achieve for yet another reason. Having an unusually large goal is an adrenaline infusion that provides the endurance to overcome the inevitable trials and tribulations that go along with any goal. Realistic goals, goals restricted to the average ambition level, are uninspiring and will only fuel you through the first or second problem, at which point you throw in the towel. If the potential payoff is mediocre or average, so is your effort. I&rsquo;ll run through walls to get a catamaran trip through the Greek islands, but I might not change my brand of cereal for a weekend trip through Columbus, Ohio. If I choose the latter because it is &ldquo;realistic,&rdquo; I won&rsquo;t have the enthusiasm to jump even the smallest hurdle to accomplish it. With beautiful, crystal-clear Greek waters and delicious wine on the brain, I&rsquo;m prepared to do battle for a dream that is worth dreaming. Even though their difficulty of achievement on a scale of 1&ndash;10 appears to be a 10 and a 2 respectively, Columbus is more likely to fall through. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">The fishing is best where the fewest go, and the collective insecurity of the world makes it easy for people to hit home runs while everyone else is aiming for base hits. There is just less competition for bigger goals. </span></p><p class="c78 c226"><span class="c4">Doing big things begins with asking for them properly. </span></p><p class="c347"><span class="c13">What Do You Want? A Better Question, First of All </span></p><p class="c248 c43"><span class="c6">M</span><span class="c4">ost people will never know what they want. I don&rsquo;t know what I want. If you ask me what I want to do in the next five months for language learning, on the other hand, I do know. It&rsquo;s a matter of specificity. &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; is too imprecise to produce a meaningful and actionable answer. Forget about it. </span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What are your goals?&rdquo; is similarly fated for confusion and guesswork. To rephrase the question, we need to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. </span></p><p class="c58 c41 c68"><span class="c4">Let&rsquo;s assume we have 10 goals and we achieve them&mdash;what is the desired outcome that makes all the effort worthwhile? The most common response is what I also would have suggested five years ago: happiness. I no longer believe this is a good answer. Happiness can be bought with a bottle of wine and has become ambiguous through overuse. There is a more precise alternative that reflects what I believe the actual objective is. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">Bear with me. What is the opposite of happiness? Sadness? No. Just as love and hate are two sides of the same coin, so are happiness and sadness. Crying out of happiness is a perfect illustration of this. The opposite of love is indifference, and the opposite of happiness is&mdash;here&rsquo;s the clincher&mdash;boredom. </span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c17">Excitement is the more practical synonym for happiness, and it is precisely what you should strive to chase. It is the cure-all</span><span class="c4">. When people suggest you follow your &ldquo;passion&rdquo; or your &ldquo;bliss,&rdquo; I propose that they are, in fact, referring to the same singular concept: excitement. </span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c4">This brings us full circle. The question you should be asking isn&rsquo;t, &ldquo;What do I want?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What are my goals?&rdquo; but &ldquo;What would excite me?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c242"><span class="c13">Adult-Onset ADD: Adventure Deficit Disorder </span></p><p class="c227 c43"><span class="c6">S</span><span class="c4">omewhere between college graduation and your second job, a chorus enters your internal dialogue: Be realistic and stop pretending.

It was to be an automated source of cash flow. If you look at my chronology, it is obvious that this didn&rsquo;t happen until a meltdown forced it, despite the requisite income. Why? The goal wasn&rsquo;t specific enough. I hadn&rsquo;t defined </span><span class="c17">alternate activities </span><span class="c4">that would replace the initial workload. Therefore, I just continued working, even though there was no financial need. I needed to feel productive and had no other vehicles. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">This is how most people work until death: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just work until I have X dollars and then do what I want.&rdquo; If you don&rsquo;t define the &ldquo;what I want&rdquo; alternate activities, the X figure will increase indefinitely to avoid the fear-inducing uncertainty of this void. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c4">This is when both employees and entrepreneurs become fat men in red BMWs. </span></p><p class="c32 c174"><span class="c13">The Fat Man in the Red BMW Convertible </span></p><p class="c233 c68"><span class="c6">T</span><span class="c4">here have been several points in my life&mdash;among them, just before I was fired from TrueSAN and just before I escaped the U.S. to avoid taking an Uzi into McDonald&rsquo;s&mdash;at which I saw my future as another fat man in a midlife-crisis BMW.

I&rsquo;ve edited it for length in a few places. </span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c4">People are fond of using the &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not what you know, it&rsquo;s who you know&rdquo; adage as an excuse for inaction, as if all successful people are born with powerful friends. </span></p><p class="c82 c149"><span class="c4">Nonsense.

Ryan Marrinan &rsquo;07, from Los Angeles, was no exception. But while the majority of undergraduates fill their time by updating their Facebook profiles or watching videos on YouTube, Marrinan was discussing Soto Zen Buddhism via e- mail with Randy Komisar, a partner at the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers, and asking Google CEO Eric Schmidt via e-mail when he had been happiest in his life. (Schmidt&rsquo;s answer: &ldquo;Tomorrow.&rdquo;) </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">Prior to his e-mail, Marrinan had never contacted Komisar. He had met Schmidt, a Princeton University trustee, only briefly at an academic affairs meeting of the trustees in November. A self-described &ldquo;naturally shy kid,&rdquo; Marrinan said he would never have dared to randomly e-mail two of the most powerful men in Silicon Valley if it weren&rsquo;t for Tim Ferriss, who offered a guest lecture in Professor Ed Zschau&rsquo;s &ldquo;High- Tech Entrepreneurship&rdquo; class. Ferriss challenged Marrinan and his fellow seniors to contact high-profile celebrities and CEOs and get their answers to questions they have always wanted to ask. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">For extra incentive, Ferriss promised the student who could contact the most hard- to-reach name and ask the most intriguing question a round-trip plane ticket anywhere in the world. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I believe that success can be measured in the number of uncomfortable conversations you&rsquo;re willing to have. I felt that if I could help students overcome the fear of rejection with cold-calling and cold e-mail, it would serve them forever,&rdquo; Ferriss said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to sell yourself short, but when you see classmates getting responses from people like [former president] George Bush, the CEOs of Disney, Comcast, Google, and HP, and dozens of other impossible-to-reach people, it forces you to reconsider your self-set limitations.&rdquo; ... Ferriss lectures to the students of &ldquo;High-Tech Entrepreneurship&rdquo; each semester about creating a startup and designing the ideal lifestyle. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I participate in this contest every day,&rdquo; said Ferriss. &ldquo;I do what I always do: find a personal e-mail if possible, often through their little-known personal blogs, send a two- to three-paragraph e-mail which explains that I am familiar with their work, and </span></p><p class="c58 c68"><span class="c4">ask one simple-to-answer but thought-provoking question in that e-mail related to their work or life philosophies. The goal is to start a dialogue so they take the time to answer future e-mails&mdash;not to ask for help. That can only come after at least three or four genuine e-mail exchanges.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">With &ldquo;textbook execution of the Tim Ferriss Technique,&rdquo; as he put it, Marrinan was able to strike up a bond with Komisar. In his initial e-mail, he talked about reading one of Komisar&rsquo;s </span><span class="c17">Harvard Business Review </span><span class="c4">articles and feeling inspired to ask him, &ldquo;When were you happiest in your life?&rdquo; After Komisar replied with references to Tibetan Buddhism, Marrinan responded, &ldquo;Just as words are inadequate to explain true happiness, so too are words inadequate to express my thanks.&rdquo; His e-mail included his personal translation of a French poem by Taisen Deshimaru, the former European head of Soto Zen. An e-mail relationship was formed, and Komisar even e-mailed Marrinan a few days later with a link to a </span><span class="c17">New York Times </span><span class="c4">article on happiness. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">Contacting Schmidt proved more challenging. For Marrinan, the toughest part was getting Schmidt&rsquo;s personal e-mail address. He e-mailed a Princeton dean asking for it. No response. Two weeks later, he e-mailed the same dean again, defending his request by reminding her that he had previously met Schmidt. The dean said no, but Marrinan refused to give up. He e-mailed her a third time. &ldquo;Have you ever made an exception?&rdquo; he asked. The dean finally gave in, he said, and provided him with Schmidt&rsquo;s e-mail. </span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I know some of my classmates pursued the alternative scattershot technique with some success, but that&rsquo;s not my bag,&rdquo; Marrinan said, explaining his perseverance. &ldquo;I deal with rejection by persisting, not by taking my business elsewhere. My maxim comes from Samuel Beckett, a personal hero of mine: &lsquo;Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.&rsquo; You won&rsquo;t believe what you can accomplish by attempting the impossible with the courage to repeatedly fail better.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">Nathan Kaplan, another participant in the contest, was most proud of the way that he was able to contact former Newark mayor Sharpe James. Because James had made a campaign contribution to Al Sharpton, the website </span><span class="c7">www.fundrace.org </span><span class="c4">listed James&rsquo;s home address. Kaplan then input James&rsquo;s address into an online serach-by-address phone directory, through which he received the former mayor&rsquo;s phone number. Kaplan left a message for James, and a few days later finally got to ask him about childhood education. </span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c4">Ferriss is proud of the effort students have put into his contest. &ldquo;Most people can do absolutely awe-inspiring things,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Sometimes they just need a little nudge.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c48 c94"><span class="c0">Q&amp;A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS </span></p><p class="c56 c370"><span class="c4">The existential vacuum manifests itself mainly in a state of boredom. &mdash;</span><span class="c3">VIKTOR FRANKL, </span><span class="c4">Auschwitz survivor and founder of Logotherapy, </span><span class="c17">Man&rsquo;s Search for Meaning </span></p><p class="c56 c212"><span class="c4">Life is too short to be small. </span></p><p class="c82 c156"><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c3">BENJAMIN DISRAELI </span></p><p class="c58 c68"><span class="c6">D</span><span class="c4">reamlining will be fun, and it will be hard.

Refer to the model worksheet as you complete the following steps: </span></p><p class="c118 c68"><span class="c4">1. </span><span class="c0">What would you do if there were no way you could fail? If you were 10 times smarter than the rest of the world? </span><span class="c4">Create two timelines&mdash;6 months and 12 months&mdash;and list up to five things you dream of </span><span class="c17">having </span><span class="c4">(including, but not limited to, material wants: house, car, clothing, etc.), </span><span class="c17">being </span><span class="c4">(be a great cook, be fluent in Chinese, etc.), and </span><span class="c17">doing </span><span class="c4">(visiting Thailand, tracing your roots overseas, racing ostriches, etc.) in that order. If you have difficulty identifying what you want in some categories, as most will, consider what you hate or fear in each and write down the opposite. Do not limit yourself, and do not concern yourself with how these things will be accomplished. For now, it&rsquo;s unimportant. This is an exercise in reversing repression. </span></p><p class="c82 c41 c301"><span class="c4">Be sure not to judge or fool yourself. If you really want a Ferrari, don&rsquo;t put down solving world hunger out of guilt. For some, the dream will be fame, for others fortune or prestige. All people have their vices and insecurities. If something will improve your feeling of self-worth, put it down. I have a racing motorcycle, and quite apart from the fact that I love speed, it just makes me feel like a cool dude. There is nothing wrong with that. Put it all down. </span></p><p class="c43 c63"><span class="c4">2. </span><span class="c0">Drawing a blank? </span><span class="c4">For all their bitching about what&rsquo;s holding them back, most people have a lot of trouble coming up with the defined dreams they&rsquo;re being held from. This is particularly true with the &ldquo;doing&rdquo; category. In that case, consider these questions: 1. What would you do, day to day, if you had $100 million in the bank? </span></p><p class="c180 c356"><span class="c4">2. What would make you most excited to wake up in the morning to another day? </span></p><p class="c113 c41 c247"><span class="c4">Don&rsquo;t rush&mdash;think about it for a few minutes. If still blocked, fill in the five &ldquo;doing&rdquo; spots with the following: </span></p><p class="c59"><span class="c4">one place to visit one thing to do before you die (a memory of a lifetime) one thing to do daily one thing to do weekly one thing you&rsquo;ve always wanted to learn </span></p><p class="c43 c46"><span class="c4">3. </span><span class="c0">What does &ldquo;being&rdquo; entail doing? </span><span class="c4">Convert each &ldquo;being&rdquo; into a &ldquo;doing&rdquo; to make it actionable. Identify an action that would characterize this state of being or a task that would mean you had achieved it. </span></p><p class="c32"><span class="c4">People find it easier to brainstorm &ldquo;being&rdquo; first, but this column is just a temporary holding spot for &ldquo;doing&rdquo; actions. Here are a few examples: </span></p><p class="c32"><span class="c17">Great cook </span></p><p class="c32"><span class="c17">have a five-minute conversation with a Chinese co-worker </span></p><p class="c58"><span class="c4">4. </span><span class="c0">What are the four dreams that would change it all? </span><span class="c4">Using the 6-month timeline, star or otherwise highlight the four most exciting and/or important dreams from all columns. Repeat the process with the 12-month timeline if desired. </span></p><p class="c58"><span class="c4">5. </span><span class="c0">Determine the cost of these dreams and calculate your Target Monthly Income (TMI) for both timelines</span><span class="c4">. If financeable, what is the cost per month for each of the four dreams (rent, mortgage, payment plan installments, etc.)? Start thinking of income and expense in terms of monthly cash flow&mdash;dollars in and dollars out&mdash;instead of grand totals. Things often cost much, much less than expected. For example, a Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder, fresh off the showroom floor at $260,000, can be had for $2,897.80 per month. I found my personal favorite, an Aston Martin DB9 with 1,000 miles on it, through eBay for $136,000&mdash;$2,003.10 per month. How about a Round-the-World trip (Los Angeles </span></p><p class="c32"><span class="c4">Los Angeles) for $1,399? For some of these costs, the Tools and Tricks at the end of </span><span class="c7">Chapter 14 </span><span class="c4">will help. Last, calculate your Target Monthly Income (TMI) for realizing these dreamlines. This is how to do it: First, total each of the columns A, B, and C, counting only the four selected dreams. Some of these column totals could be zero, which is fine. Next, add your total monthly expenses </span><span class="c0">x </span><span class="c4">1.3 (the 1.3 represents your expenses plus a 30% buffer for safety or savings). This grand total is your TMI and the target to keep in mind for the rest of the book. I like to further divide this TMI by 30 to get my TDI&mdash; Target Daily Income. I find it easier to work with a daily goal. Online calculators on our companion site do all the work for you and make this step a cinch. </span></p><p class="c32"><span class="c4">Chances are that the figure is lower than expected, and it often decreases over time as you trade more and more &ldquo;having&rdquo; for once-in-a-lifetime &ldquo;doing.&rdquo; Mobility encourages this trend. Even if the total is intimidating, don&rsquo;t fret in the least. I have helped students get to more than $10,000 per month in extra income within three months. </span></p><p class="c32"><span class="c4">Sample Dreamline </span></p><p class="c32"><span class="c4">Tokyo </span></p><p class="c32"><span class="c17">make Christmas dinner without help Fluent in Chinese </span></p><p class="c32"><span class="c4">Singapore </span></p><p class="c32"><span class="c4">Bangkok </span></p><p class="c32"><span class="c4">Delhi or Bombay </span></p><p class="c32"><span class="c4">London </span></p><p class="c32"><span class="c4">Frankfurt </span></p><p class="c171"><span class="c4">Dreamline </span></p><p class="c56 c206"><span class="c4">(Go to </span><span class="c7">www.fourhourblog.com </span><span class="c4">for larger printable worksheets and online calculators.) </span></p><p class="c289"><span class="c0">Dreamline Math&mdash;Another Good Option </span></p><p class="c58 c43"><span class="c6">T</span><span class="c4">here could be a different way of handling monthly and one-time goals. I&rsquo;ll use your example of an Aston Martin&rsquo;s monthly payment, a personal assistant&rsquo;s monthly payment, and a trip to the Croatian coast. While the first two should certainly be totaled and included in your target monthly income, the trip is something that should be divided by the number of months between now and the dreamline&rsquo;s total time. </span></p><p class="c82 c173"><span class="c4">Thus if you had a six-month dreamline: </span></p><p class="c28"><span class="c4">Aston Martin = 2,003 per month Personal assistant = 400 per month Croatian trip = 934 total, and thus 934/6 per month </span></p><p class="c56 c43 c41"><span class="c4">Right now in the book and in the spreadsheet we have (2003 + 400 + 934) </span><span class="c0">x </span><span class="c4">1.3 monthly expenses = Target Monthly Income (or TMI). </span></p><p class="c82 c43"><span class="c4">But I think it should be (2003 + 400 + 934/6 </span><span class="c0">x </span><span class="c4">1.3 monthly expenses = TMI. Or, more generally: [Monthly Goals + (One-Time Goals / Total Months)] </span><span class="c0">x </span><span class="c4">1.3 monthly expenses = TMI. </span></p><p class="c82 c183"><span class="c19">&mdash; </span><span class="c33">JARED </span><span class="c19">, president, </span><span class="c33">SET </span><span class="c19">Consulting </span></p><p class="c68 c366"><span class="c4">6. </span><span class="c0">Determine </span><span class="c19">three steps </span><span class="c0">for each of the </span><span class="c19">four dreams </span><span class="c0">in just the 6-month timeline and take the first step </span><span class="c19">now</span><span class="c4">. I&rsquo;m not a big believer in long-term planning and far-off goals. In fact, I generally set 3-month and 6-month dreamlines. The variables change too much and in-the-future distance becomes an excuse for postponing action. The objective of this exercise isn&rsquo;t, therefore, to outline every step from start to finish, but to define the end goal, the required vehicle to achieve them (TMI, TDI), and build momentum with critical first steps. From that point, it&rsquo;s a matter of freeing time and generating the TMI, which the following chapters cover. </span></p><p class="c82 c41 c364"><span class="c4">First, let&rsquo;s focus on those critical first steps. Define three steps for each dream that will get you closer to its actualization. Set actions&mdash;simple, well-defined actions&mdash;for now, tomorrow (complete before 11 </span><span class="c3">A.M</span><span class="c4">.) and the day after (again completed before 11 </span><span class="c3">A.M</span><span class="c4">.). </span></p><p class="c82 c41 c210"><span class="c4">Once you have three steps for each of the four goals, complete the three actions in the &ldquo;now&rdquo; column. Do it now. Each should be simple enough to do in five minutes or less. If not, rachet it down. If it&rsquo;s the middle of the night and you can&rsquo;t call someone, do something else now, such as send an e-mail, and set the call for first thing tomorrow. </span></p><p class="c82 c41 c331"><span class="c4">If the next stage is some form of research, get in touch with someone who knows the answer instead of spending too much time in books or online, which can turn into paralysis by analysis. The best first step, the one I recommend, is finding someone who&rsquo;s done it and ask for advice on how to do the same. It&rsquo;s not hard. </span></p><p class="c32 c41 c224"><span class="c4">Other options include setting a meeting or phone call with a trainer, mentor, or salesperson to build momentum. Can you schedule a private class or a commitment that you&rsquo;ll feel bad about canceling? Use guilt to your advantage. </span></p><p class="c82 c316"><span class="c4">Tomorrow becomes never. No matter how small the task, take the first step now! </span></p><p class="c48 c112"><span class="c0">COMFORT CHALLENGE </span></p><p class="c76 c109"><span class="c6">T</span><span class="c4">he most important actions are never comfortable. </span></p><p class="c43 c41 c217"><span class="c4">Fortunately, it is possible to condition yourself to discomfort and overcome it. I&rsquo;ve trained myself to propose solutions instead of ask for them, to elicit desired responses instead of react, and to be assertive without burning bridges. To have an uncommon lifestyle, you need to </span><span class="c17">develop the uncommon habit of making decisions, both for yourself and for others</span><span class="c4">. </span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c4">From this chapter forward, I&rsquo;ll take you through progressively more uncomfortable exercises, simple and small. Some of the exercises will appear deceptively easy and even irrelevant (such as the next) until you try them. Look at it as a game and expect some butterflies and sweat&mdash;that&rsquo;s the whole point. For most of these exercises, the duration is two days. Mark the exercise of the day on your calendar so you don&rsquo;t forget, and don&rsquo;t attempt more than one Comfort Challenge at a time. </span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c4">Remember: There is a direct correlation between an increased sphere of comfort and getting what you want. </span></p><p class="c82 c272"><span class="c4">Here we go. </span></p><p class="c105 c43"><span class="c0">Learn to Eye Gaze (2 days) </span><span class="c4">My friend Michael Ellsberg invented a singles event called Eye Gazing. It is similar to speed dating but different in one fundamental respect&mdash;no speaking is permitted. It involves gazing into the eyes of each partner for three minutes at a time. If you go to such an event, it becomes clear how uncomfortable most people are doing this. For the next two days, practice gazing into the eyes of others&mdash;whether people you pass on the street or conversational partners&mdash;until they break contact. Hints: </span></p><p class="c82 c180"><span class="c4">1. Focus on one eye and be sure to blink occasionally so you don&rsquo;t look like a psychopath or get your ass kicked. </span></p><p class="c61"><span class="c4">2. In conversation, maintain eye contact when you are speaking. It&rsquo;s easy to do while listening. </span></p><p class="c31"><span class="c4">3. Practice with people bigger or more confident than yourself. If a passerby asks you what the hell you&rsquo;re staring at, just smile and respond, &ldquo;Sorry about that. I thought you were an old friend of mine.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c257"><span class="c0">ILLUSIONS AND ITALIANS </span></p><p class="c73"><span class="c4">Perfection is not when there is no more to add, but no more to take away. &mdash;</span><span class="c3">ANTOINE DE SAINT-EXUP&Eacute;RY</span><span class="c4">, pioneer of international postal flight and author of </span><span class="c17">Le Petit Prince (The Little Prince) </span></p><p class="c48 c127"><span class="c4">It is vain to do with more what can be done with less. &mdash;</span><span class="c3">WILLIAM OF OCCAM </span><span class="c4">(1300&ndash;1350), originator of &ldquo;Occam&rsquo;s Razor&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c76 c351"><span class="c6">J</span><span class="c4">ust a few words on time management: Forget all about it. </span></p><p class="c217 c43 c41"><span class="c4">In the strictest sense, you shouldn&rsquo;t be trying to do more in each day, trying to fill every second with a work fidget of some type. It took me a long time to figure this out. I used to be very fond of the results-by-volume approach. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">Being busy is most often used as a guise for avoiding the few critically important but uncomfortable actions. The options are almost limitless for creating &ldquo;busyness&rdquo;: You could call a few hundred unqualified sales leads, reorganize your Outlook contacts, walk across the office to request documents you don&rsquo;t really need, or fuss with your BlackBerry for a few hours when you should be prioritizing. </span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c4">In fact, if you want to move up the ladder in most of corporate America, and assuming they don&rsquo;t really check what you are doing (let&rsquo;s be honest), just run around </span></p><p class="c273"><span class="c13">Step II: E is for Elimination </span></p><p class="c128"><span class="c13">One does not accumulate but eliminate </span><span class="c2">. </span><span class="c13">It is not daily increase but daily decrease.

Hit yourself with a newspaper and cut it out. </span></p><p class="c38 c41"><span class="c4">After all, there is a far better option, and it will do more than simply increase your results&mdash;it will multiply them.

Enter the world of elimination. </span></p><p class="c196"><span class="c13">How You Will Use Productivity </span></p><p class="c233 c43"><span class="c6">N</span><span class="c4">ow that you have defined what you want to do with your time, you have to free that time. The trick, of course, is to do so while maintaining or increasing your income. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">The intention of this chapter, and what you will experience if you follow the instructions, is an increase in personal productivity between 100 and 500%. The </span><span class="c17">principles </span><span class="c4">are the same for both employees and entrepreneurs, but the </span><span class="c17">purpose </span><span class="c4">of this increased productivity is completely different. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">First, the employee. The employee is increasing productivity to increase negotiating leverage for two simultaneous objectives: pay raises and a remote working arrangement. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">Recall that, as indicated in the first chapter of this book, the general process of joining the New Rich is </span><span class="c0">D-E-A-L</span><span class="c4">, in that order, but that employees intent on remaining employees for now need to implement the process as </span><span class="c0">D-E-L-A</span><span class="c4">. The reason relates to environment. They need to </span><span class="c0">Liberate </span><span class="c4">themselves from the office environment before they can work ten hours a week, for example, because the expectation in that environment is that you will be in constant motion from 9&ndash;5. Even if you produce twice the results you had in the past, if you&rsquo;re working a quarter of the hours of your colleagues, there is a good chance of receiving a pink slip. Even if you work 10 hours a week and produce twice the results of people working 40, the collective request will be, &ldquo;Work 40 hours a week and produce 8 times the results.&rdquo; This is an endless game and one you want to avoid. Hence the need for </span><span class="c0">Liberation </span><span class="c4">first. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">If you&rsquo;re an employee, this chapter will increase your value and make it more painful for the company to fire you than to grant raises and a remote working agreement. That is your goal. Once the latter is accomplished, you can drop hours without bureaucratic interference and use the resultant free time to fulfill dreamlines. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">The entrepreneur&rsquo;s goals are less complex, as he or she is generally the direct beneficiary of increased profit. The goal is to decrease the amount of work you perform while increasing revenue. This will set the stage for replacing yourself with </span><span class="c0">Automation</span><span class="c4">, which in turn permits </span><span class="c0">Liberation</span><span class="c4">. </span></p><p class="c32 c89"><span class="c4">For both tracks, some definitions are in order. </span></p><p class="c305"><span class="c13">Being Effective vs. Being Efficient </span></p><p class="c233 c43"><span class="c6">E</span><span class="c4">ffectiveness is doing the things that get you closer to your goals. Efficiency is performing a given task (whether important or not) in the most economical manner possible. Being efficient without regard to effectiveness is the default mode of the universe. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">I would consider the best door-to-door salesperson efficient&mdash;that is, refined and excellent at selling door-to-door without wasting time&mdash;but utterly ineffective. He or she would sell more using a better vehicle such as e-mail or direct mail. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">This is also true for the person who checks e-mail 30 times per day and develops an elaborate system of folder rules and sophisticated techniques for ensuring that each of those 30 brain farts moves as quickly as possible. I was a specialist at such professional wheel-spinning. It is efficient on some perverse level, but far from effective. </span></p><p class="c82 c91"><span class="c4">Here are two truisms to keep in mind: </span></p><p class="c78 c139"><span class="c4">1. Doing something unimportant well does not make it important. </span></p><p class="c339"><span class="c4">2. Requiring a lot of time does not make a task important. </span></p><p class="c43 c41 c122"><span class="c4">From this moment forward, remember this: </span><span class="c17">What </span><span class="c4">you do is infinitely more important than </span><span class="c17">how </span><span class="c4">you do it. Efficiency is still important, but it is useless unless applied to the right things. </span></p><p class="c47"><span class="c4">To find the right things, we&rsquo;ll need to go to the garden. </span></p><p class="c130"><span class="c13">Pareto and His Garden: 80/20 and Freedom from Futility </span></p><p class="c146 c207"><span class="c4">What gets measured gets managed. &mdash;</span><span class="c3">PETER DRUCKER</span><span class="c4">, management theorist, author of 31 books, recipient of Presidential Medal of Freedom </span></p><p class="c76 c43"><span class="c6">F</span><span class="c4">our years ago, an economist changed my life forever. It&rsquo;s a shame I never had a chance to buy him a drink. My dear Vilfredo died almost 100 years ago. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c4">Vilfredo Pareto was a wily and controversial economist-cum-sociologist who lived from 1848 to 1923. An engineer by training, he started his varied career managing coal mines and later succeeded L&eacute;on Walras as the chair of political economy at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. His seminal work, </span><span class="c17">Cours d&rsquo;economie politique</span><span class="c4">, included a then little-explored &ldquo;law&rdquo; of income distribution that would later bear his name: &ldquo;Pareto&rsquo;s Law&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Pareto Distribution,&rdquo; in the last decade also popularly called the &ldquo;80/20 Principle.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">The mathematical formula he used to demonstrate a grossly uneven but predictable distribution of wealth in society&mdash;80% of the wealth and income was produced and possessed by 20% of the population&mdash;also applied outside of economics. Indeed, it could be found almost everywhere. Eighty percent of Pareto&rsquo;s garden peas were produced by 20% of the peapods he had planted, for example. </span></p><p class="c38 c41"><span class="c4">Pareto&rsquo;s Law can be summarized as follows: 80% of the outputs result from 20% of the inputs. Alternative ways to phrase this, depending on the context, include: </span></p><p class="c56 c43"><span class="c4">80% of the consequences flow from 20% of the causes. 80% of the results come from 20% of the effort and time. 80% of company profits come from 20% of the products and customers. 80% of all stock market gains are realized by 20% of the investors and 20% of an individual portfolio. </span></p><p class="c74 c43"><span class="c4">The list is infinitely long and diverse, and the ratio is often skewed even more severely: 90/10, 95/5, and 99/1 are not uncommon, but the minimum ratio to seek is 80/20. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">When I came across Pareto&rsquo;s work one late evening, I had been slaving away with 15-hour days seven days per week, feeling completely overwhelmed and generally helpless. I would wake up before dawn to make calls to the United Kingdom, handle the U.S. during the normal 9&ndash;5 day, and then work until near midnight making calls to Japan and New Zealand. I was stuck on a runaway freight train with no brakes, shoveling coal into the furnace for lack of a better option. Faced with certain burnout or giving Pareto&rsquo;s ideas a trial run, I opted for the latter. The next morning, I began a dissection of my business and personal life through the lenses of two questions: </span></p><p class="c78 c357"><span class="c4">1. Which 20% of sources are causing 80% of my problems and unhappiness? </span></p><p class="c61"><span class="c4">2. Which 20% of sources are resulting in 80% of my desired outcomes and happiness? </span></p><p class="c74 c43 c41"><span class="c4">For the entire day, I put aside everything seemingly urgent and did the most intense truth-baring analysis possible, applying these questions to everything from my friends to customers and advertising to relaxation activities. Don&rsquo;t expect to find you&rsquo;re doing everything right&mdash;the truth often hurts. The goal is to find your inefficiencies in order to eliminate them and to find your strengths so you can multiply them. In the 24 hours </span></p><p class="c32 c43"><span class="c4">that followed, I made several simple but emotionally difficult decisions that literally changed my life forever and enabled the lifestyle I now enjoy. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">The first decision I made is an excellent example of how dramatic and fast the ROI of this analytical fat-cutting can be: I stopped contacting 95% of my customers and fired 2%, leaving me with the top 3% of producers to profile and duplicate. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">Out of more than 120 wholesale customers, a mere 5 were bringing in 95% of the revenue. I was spending 98% of my time chasing the remainder, as the aforementioned 5 ordered regularly without any follow-up calls, persuasion, or cajoling. In other words, I was working because I felt as though I should be doing something from 9&ndash;5. I didn&rsquo;t realize that working every hour from 9&ndash;5 isn&rsquo;t the goal; it&rsquo;s simply the structure most people use, whether it&rsquo;s necessary or not. I had a severe case of work-for-work (W4W), the most-hated acronym in the </span><span class="c0">NR </span><span class="c4">vocabulary. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">All, and I mean 100%, of my problems and complaints came from this unproductive majority, with the exception of two large customers who were simply world-class experts of the &ldquo;here is the fire I started, now you put it out&rdquo; approach to business. I put all of these unproductive customers on passive mode: If they ordered, great&mdash;let them fax in the order. If not, I would do absolutely no chasing: no phone calls, no e-mail, nothing. That left the two larger customers to deal with, who were professional ball breakers but contributed about 10% to the bottom line at the time. </span></p><p class="c38 c41"><span class="c4">You&rsquo;ll always have a few of these, and it is a quandary that causes all sorts of problems, not the least of which are self-hatred and depression. Up to that point, I had taken their browbeating, insults, time-consuming arguments, and tirades as a cost of doing business. I realized during the 80/20 analysis that these two people were the source of nearly all my unhappiness and anger throughout the day, and it usually spilled over into my personal time, keeping me up at night with the usual &ldquo;I should have said X, Y, and Z to that penis&rdquo; self-flagellation. I finally concluded the obvious: The effect on my self-esteem and state of mind just wasn&rsquo;t worth the financial gain. I didn&rsquo;t need the money for any precise reason, and I had assumed I needed to take it. The customers are always right, aren&rsquo;t they? Part of doing business, right? Hell, no. Not for the </span><span class="c0">NR</span><span class="c4">, anyway. I fired their asses and enjoyed every second of it. The first conversation went like this: </span><span class="c0">Customer: </span><span class="c4">What the &amp;#@$? I ordered two cases and they arrived two days late. [Note: He had sent the order to the wrong person via the wrong medium, despite repeated reminders.] You guys are the most disorganized bunch of idiots I&rsquo;ve ever worked with. I have 20 years of experience in this industry, and this is the worst. </span><span class="c0">Any NR</span><span class="c4">&mdash;in this case, me: I will kill you. Be afraid, be very afraid. </span></p><p class="c40"><span class="c4">I wish. I did rehearse that a million times in my mental theater, but it actually went something more like this: </span></p><p class="c118 c43"><span class="c4">I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that. You know, I&rsquo;ve been taking your insults for a while now, and it&rsquo;s unfortunate that it seems we won&rsquo;t be able to do business anymore. I&rsquo;d recommend you take a good look at where this unhappiness and anger is actually coming from. In any case, I wish you well. If you would like to order product, we&rsquo;ll be </span></p><p class="c58 c68"><span class="c4">happy to supply it, but only if you can conduct yourself without profanity and unnecessary insults. You have our fax number. All the best and have a nice day. [Click.] </span></p><p class="c74 c43 c41"><span class="c4">I did this once via phone and once through e-mail. So what happened? I lost one customer, but the other corrected course and simply faxed orders, again and again and again. Problem solved, minimum revenue lost. I was immediately 10 times happier. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">I then identified the common characteristics of my top-five customers and secured three or so similarly profiled buyers in the following week. Remember, more customers is not automatically more income. More customers is not the goal and often translates into 90% more housekeeping and a paltry 1&ndash;3% increase in income. Make no mistake, maximum income from minimal necessary effort (including minimum number of customers) is the primary goal. I duplicated my strengths, in this case my top producers, and focused on increasing the size and frequency of their orders. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">The end result? I went from chasing and appeasing 120 customers to simply receiving large orders from 8, with absolutely no pleading phone calls or e-mail haranguing. My monthly income increased from $30K to $60K in four weeks and my weekly hours immediately dropped from over 80 to approximately 15. Most important, I was happy with myself and felt both optimistic and liberated for the first time in over two years. </span></p><p class="c78 c43 c41"><span class="c4">In the ensuing weeks, I applied the 80/20 Principle to dozens of areas, including the following: </span></p><p class="c43 c48"><span class="c0">1. Advertising </span><span class="c4">I identified the advertising that was generating 80% or more of revenue, identified the commonalities among them, and multiplied them, eliminating all the rest at the same time. My advertising costs dropped over 70% and my direct sales income nearly doubled from a monthly $15K to $25K in 8 weeks. It would have doubled immediately had I been using radio, newspapers, or television instead of magazines with long lead times. </span></p><p class="c105 c43"><span class="c0">2. Online Affiliates and Partners </span><span class="c4">I fired more than 250 low-yield online affiliates or put them in holding patterns to focus instead on the </span><span class="c17">two </span><span class="c4">affiliates who were generating 90% of the income. My management time decreased from 5&ndash;10 hours per week to 1 hour per month. Online partner income increased more than 50% in that same month. </span></p><p class="c105 c43"><span class="c4">Slow down and remember this: Most things make no difference. </span><span class="c17">Being busy is a form of laziness&mdash;lazy thinking and indiscriminate action</span><span class="c4">. </span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c4">Being overwhelmed is often as unproductive as doing nothing, and is far more unpleasant. Being selective&mdash;doing less&mdash;is the path of the productive. Focus on the important few and ignore the rest. </span></p><p class="c58 c68 c41"><span class="c4">Of course, before you can separate the wheat from the chaff and eliminate activities in a new environment (whether a new job or an entrepreneurial venture), you will need to try a lot to identify what pulls the most weight. Throw it all up on the wall and see what sticks. That&rsquo;s part of the process, but it should not take more than a month or two. </span><span class="c45">It&rsquo;s easy to get caught in a flood of minutiae, and the key to not feeling rushed is </span><span class="c4">remembering that </span><span class="c17">lack of time is actually lack of priorities</span><span class="c4">. Take time to stop and smell the roses, or&mdash;in this case&mdash;to count the pea pods. </span></p><p class="c367"><span class="c13">The 9&ndash;5 Illusion and Parkinson&rsquo;s Law </span></p><p class="c146 c326"><span class="c4">I saw a bank that said &ldquo;24-Hour Banking,&rdquo; but I don&rsquo;t have that much time. </span></p><p class="c82 c320"><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c3">STEVEN WRIGHT, </span><span class="c4">comedian </span></p><p class="c84 c43"><span class="c6">I</span><span class="c4">f you&rsquo;re an employee, spending time on nonsense is, to some extent, not your fault. There is often no incentive to use time well unless you are paid on commission. The world has agreed to shuffle papers between 9:00 </span><span class="c3">A.M. </span><span class="c4">and 5:00 </span><span class="c3">P.M</span><span class="c4">., and since you&rsquo;re trapped in the office for that period of servitude, you are compelled to create activities to fill that time. Time is wasted because there is so much time available. It&rsquo;s understandable. Now that you have the new goal of negotiating a remote work arrangement instead of just collecting a paycheck, it&rsquo;s time to revisit the status quo and become effective. The best employees have the most leverage. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">For the entrepreneur, the wasteful use of time is a matter of bad habit and imitation. I am no exception. Most entrepreneurs were once employees and come from the 9&ndash;5 culture. Thus they adopt the same schedule, whether or not they function at 9:00 </span><span class="c3">A.M. </span><span class="c4">or need 8 hours to generate their target income. This schedule is a collective social agreement and a dinosaur legacy of the results-by-volume approach. How is it possible that all the people in the world need exactly 8 hours to accomplish their work? It isn&rsquo;t. 9&ndash;5 is arbitrary. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">You don&rsquo;t need 8 hours per day to become a legitimate millionaire&mdash;let alone have the means to live like one. Eight hours per week is often excessive, but I don&rsquo;t expect all of you to believe me just yet. I know you probably feel as I did for a long time: There just aren&rsquo;t enough hours in the day. </span></p><p class="c82 c43"><span class="c4">But let&rsquo;s consider a few things we can probably agree on. Since we have 8 hours to fill, we fill 8 hours. If we had 15, we would fill 15. If we have an emergency and need to suddenly leave work in 2 hours but have pending deadlines, we miraculously complete those assignments in 2 hours. </span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c4">It is all related to a law that was introduced to me by Ed Zschau in the spring of 2000. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c4">I had arrived to class nervous and unable to concentrate. The final paper, worth a full 25% of the semester&rsquo;s grade, was due in 24 hours. One of the options, and that which I had chosen, was to interview the top executives of a start-up and provide an in-depth analysis of their business model. The corporate powers that be had decided last minute that I couldn&rsquo;t interview two key figures or use their information due to confidentiality issues and pre-IPO precautions. Game over. </span></p><p class="c82 c43"><span class="c4">I approached Ed after class to deliver the bad news. &ldquo;Ed, I think I&rsquo;m going to need an extension on the paper.&rdquo; I explained the situation, and Ed smiled before he replied without so much as a hint of concern. </span></p><p class="c57"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll be OK. Entrepreneurs are those who make things happen, right?&rdquo; Twenty-four hours later and one minute before the deadline, as his assistant was locking the office, I handed in a 30-page final paper. It was based on a different company I had found, interviewed, and dissected with an intense all-nighter and enough caffeine to get an entire Olympic track team disqualified. It ended up being one of the best papers I&rsquo;d written in four years, and I received an A. </span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c4">Before I left the classroom the previous day, Ed had given me some parting advice: Parkinson&rsquo;s Law. </span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c4">Parkinson&rsquo;s Law dictates that a task will swell in (perceived) importance and complexity in relation to the time allotted for its completion. It is the magic of the imminent deadline. If I give you 24 hours to complete a project, the time pressure forces you to focus on execution, and you have no choice but to do only the bare essentials. If I give you a week to complete the same task, it&rsquo;s six days of making a mountain out of a molehill. If I give you two months, God forbid, it becomes a mental monster. The end product of the shorter deadline is almost inevitably of equal or higher quality due to greater focus. </span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c4">This presents a very curious phenomenon. There are two synergistic approaches for increasing productivity that are inversions of each other: </span></p><p class="c82 c280"><span class="c4">1.

Shorten work time to limit tasks to the important (Parkinson&rsquo;s Law). </span></p><p class="c68 c41 c113"><span class="c4">The best solution is to use both together: Identify the few critical tasks that contribute most to income and schedule them with </span><span class="c17">very short </span><span class="c4">and clear deadlines. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">If you haven&rsquo;t identified the mission-critical tasks and set aggressive start and end times for their completion, the unimportant becomes the important. Even if you know what&rsquo;s critical, without deadlines that create focus, the minor tasks forced upon you (or invented, in the case of the entrepreneur) will swell to consume time until another bit of minutiae jumps in to replace it, leaving you at the end of the day with nothing accomplished. How else could dropping off a package at UPS, setting a few appointments, and checking e-mail consume an entire 9&ndash;5 day? Don&rsquo;t feel bad. I spent months jumping from one interruption to the next, feeling run by my business instead of the other way around. </span></p><p class="c58 c43"><span class="c4">T</span><span class="c3">HE 80/20 </span><span class="c4">P</span><span class="c3">RINCIPLE </span><span class="c4">and Parkinson&rsquo;s Law are the two cornerstone concepts that will be revisited in different forms throughout this entire section.

It was true. Can you eat All-Bran and chicken seven days a week? Me neither. Don&rsquo;t be so judgmental. </span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c4">Between my tenth and twelfth cupcakes, I plopped down on the couch to revel in the sugar high until the clock struck midnight and sent me back to my adultsville Sunday&ndash;Friday diet. There was another party guest seated next to me on a chair, nursing a glass of wine, not his twelfth but certainly not his first, and we struck up a conversation. As usual, I had to struggle to answer &ldquo;What do you do?&rdquo; and, as usual, my answer left someone to wonder whether I was a pathological liar or a criminal. </span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c4">How was it possible to spend so little time on income generation? It&rsquo;s a good question. It&rsquo;s THE question. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">In almost all respects, Charney had it all. He was happily married with a two-year- old son and another due to arrive in three months. He was a successful technology salesman, and though he wanted to earn $500,000 more per year as all do, his finances were solid. </span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c4">He also asked good questions. I had just returned from another trip overseas and was planning a new adventure to Japan. He drilled me for two hours with a refrain: How is it possible to spend so little time on income generation? </span></p><p class="c78 c43 c41"><span class="c4">&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re interested, we can make you a case study and I&rsquo;ll show you how,&rdquo; I offered. </span></p><p class="c38"><span class="c4">Charney was in. The one thing he didn&rsquo;t have was time. One e-mail and five weeks of practice later, Charney had good news: He had accomplished more in the last week than he had in the previous four combined. He did so while taking Monday and Friday off and spending at least 2 more hours per day with his family. From 40 hours per week, he was down to 18 and producing four times the results. </span></p><p class="c58 c68 c41"><span class="c4">Was it from mountaintop retreats and secret kung fu training? Nope. Was it a new Japanese management secret or better software? Nein. I just asked him to do one simple thing consistently without fail. </span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c4">At least three times per day at scheduled times, he had to ask himself the following question: </span></p><p class="c48 c199"><span class="c0">Am I being productive or just active? </span></p><p class="c56 c311"><span class="c4">Charney captured the essence of this with less-abstract wording: </span></p><p class="c48 c201"><span class="c0">Am I inventing things to do to avoid the important? </span></p><p class="c118 c43"><span class="c4">He eliminated all of the activities he used as crutches and began to focus on demonstrating results instead of showing dedication.

Be ruthless and cut the fat. </span></p><p class="c82 c225"><span class="c4">It is possible to have your cupcake and eat it, too. </span></p><p class="c105 c94"><span class="c0">Q&amp;A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS </span></p><p class="c56 c65"><span class="c4">We create stress for ourselves because you feel like you have to do it.

I don&rsquo;t feel that anymore. &mdash;</span><span class="c3">OPRAH WINFREY</span><span class="c4">, actress and talk-show host, </span><span class="c17">The Oprah Winfrey Show </span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c6">T</span><span class="c4">he key to having more time is doing less, and there are two paths to getting there, both of which should be used together: (1) Define a to-do list and (2) define a not-to- do list. In general terms, there are but two questions: </span></p><p class="c48 c120"><span class="c4">What 20% of sources are causing 80% of my problems and unhappiness? What 20% of sources are resulting in 80% of my desired outcome and happiness? Hypothetical cases help to get us started: </span></p><p class="c141 c68"><span class="c4">1. </span><span class="c0">If you had a heart attack and had to work two hours per day, what would you do? </span><span class="c4">Not five hours, not four hours, not three&mdash;two hours. It&rsquo;s not where I want you to ultimately be, but it&rsquo;s a start. Besides, I can hear your brain bubbling already: That&rsquo;s ridiculous. Impossible! I know, I know. If I told you that you could survive for months, functioning quite well, on four hours of sleep per night, would you believe me? Probably not. Notwithstanding, millions of new mothers do it all the time. This exercise is not optional. The doctor has warned you, after triple-bypass surgery, that if you don&rsquo;t cut down your work to two hours per day for the first three months post-op, you will die. How would you do it? </span></p><p class="c32"><span class="c4">2. </span><span class="c0">If you had a second heart attack and had to work two hours per </span><span class="c19">week</span><span class="c4">, </span><span class="c0">what would you do? </span><span class="c4">3. </span><span class="c0">If you had a gun to your head and </span><span class="c19">had </span><span class="c0">to stop doing 4/5 of different time- consuming activities, what would you remove? </span><span class="c4">Simplicity requires ruthlessness. If you had to stop </span></p><p class="c58"><span class="c4">of time-consuming activities&mdash;e-mail, phone calls, conversations, paperwork, meetings, advertising, customers, suppliers, products, services, etc.&mdash;what would you eliminate to keep the negative effect on income to a minimum? Used even once per month, this question alone can keep you sane and on track. </span></p><p class="c32"><span class="c4">4. </span><span class="c0">What are the top-three activities that I use to fill time to feel as though I&rsquo;ve been productive? </span><span class="c4">These are usually used to postpone more important actions (often uncomfortable because there is a chance of failure or rejection). Be honest with yourself, as we all do this on occasion. What are your crutch activities? 5. </span><span class="c0">Who are the 20% of people who produce 80% of your enjoyment and propel you forward, and which 20% cause 80% of your depression, anger, and second- guessing? </span><span class="c4">Identify: </span></p><p class="c32"><span class="c15">&bull; </span></p><p class="c58"><span class="c2">Positive friends versus time-consuming friends: Who is helping versus hurting you, and how do you increase your time with the former while decreasing or eliminating your time with the latter? </span></p><p class="c32"><span class="c15">&bull; </span></p><p class="c58"><span class="c2">Who is causing me stress disproportionate to the time I spend with them? What will happen if I simply stop interacting with these people? Fear- setting helps here. </span></p><p class="c32"><span class="c15">&bull; </span></p><p class="c58"><span class="c2">When do I feel starved for time? What commitments, thoughts, and people can I eliminate to fix this problem? </span></p><p class="c58"><span class="c4">Exact numbers aren&rsquo;t needed to realize that we spend too much time with those who poison us with pessimism, sloth, and low expectations of themselves and the world. It is often the case that you have to fire certain friends or retire from particular social circles to have the life you want. This isn&rsquo;t being mean; it is being practical. Poisonous people do not deserve your time. To think otherwise is masochistic. </span></p><p class="c32"><span class="c4">The best way to approach a potential break is simple: Confide in them honestly but tactfully and explain your concerns. If they bite back, your conclusions have been confirmed. Drop them like any other bad habit. If they promise to change, first spend </span></p><p class="c32 c222"><span class="c4">at least two weeks apart to develop other positive influences in your life and diminish psychological dependency. The next trial period should have a set duration and consist of pass-or-fail criteria. </span></p><p class="c41 c80"><span class="c4">If this approach is too confrontational for you, just politely refuse to interact with them. Be in the middle of something when the call comes, and have a prior commitment when the invitation to hang out comes. Once you see the benefits of decreased time with these people, it will be easier to stop communication altogether. I&rsquo;m not going to lie: It sucks. It hurts like pulling out a splinter. But you are the average of the five people you associate with most, so do not underestimate the effects of your pessimistic, unambitious, or disorganized friends. If someone isn&rsquo;t making you stronger, they&rsquo;re making you weaker. </span></p><p class="c57 c41"><span class="c4">Remove the splinters and you&rsquo;ll thank yourself for it. 6. </span><span class="c0">Learn to ask, &ldquo;If this is the only thing I accomplish today, will I be satisfied with my day?&rdquo; </span><span class="c4">Don&rsquo;t ever arrive at the office or in front of your computer without a clear list of priorities. You&rsquo;ll just read unassociated e-mail and scramble your brain for the day. Compile your to-do list for tomorrow no later than this evening. I don&rsquo;t recommend using Outlook or computerized to-do lists, because it is possible to add an infinite number of items. I use a standard piece of paper folded in half three times, which fits perfectly in the pocket and limits you to noting only a few items. </span></p><p class="c82 c41 c193"><span class="c4">There should never be more than two mission-critical items to complete each day. Never. It just isn&rsquo;t necessary if they&rsquo;re actually high-impact. If you are stuck trying to decide between multiple items that all seem crucial, as happens to all of us, look at each in turn and ask yourself, </span><span class="c17">If this is the only thing I accomplish today, will I be satisfied with my day? </span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c4">To counter the seemingly urgent, ask yourself: What will happen if I don&rsquo;t do this, and is it worth putting off the important to do it? If you haven&rsquo;t already accomplished at least one important task in the day, don&rsquo;t spend the last business hour returning a DVD to avoid a $5 late charge. Get the important task done and pay the $5 fine. </span></p><p class="c68 c281"><span class="c4">7. </span><span class="c0">Put a Post-it on your computer screen or set an Outlook reminder to alert you at least three times daily with the question: Are you inventing things to do to avoid the important? </span><span class="c4">I also use free time-tracking software called RescueTime (</span><span class="c7">www.rescuetime.com</span><span class="c4">) to alert me when I spend more than an allotted time on certain websites or programs often used to avoid the important (Gmail, Facebook, Outlook, etc.). It also summarizes your time use each week and compares your performance to peers. 8. </span><span class="c0">Do not multitask</span><span class="c4">. I&rsquo;m going to tell you what you already know. Trying to brush your teeth, talk on the phone, and answer e-mail at the same time just doesn&rsquo;t work. Eating while doing online research and instant messaging? Ditto. </span></p><p class="c82 c41 c220"><span class="c4">If you prioritize properly, there is no need to multitask. It is a symptom of &ldquo;task creep&rdquo;&mdash;doing more to feel productive while actually accomplishing less. As stated, you should have, at most, two primary goals or tasks per day. Do them separately </span></p><p class="c32 c68"><span class="c4">from start to finish without distraction. Divided attention will result in more frequent interruptions, lapses in concentration, poorer net results, and less gratification. 9. </span><span class="c0">Use Parkinson&rsquo;s Law on a Macro and Micro Level</span><span class="c4">. Use Parkinson&rsquo;s Law to accomplish more in less time. Shorten schedules and deadlines to necessitate focused action instead of deliberation and procrastination. </span></p><p class="c82 c41 c359"><span class="c4">On a weekly and daily macro level, attempt to take Monday and/or Friday off, as well as leave work at 4 </span><span class="c3">P.M. </span><span class="c4">This will focus you to prioritize more effectively and quite possibly develop a social life. If you&rsquo;re under the hawklike watch of a boss, we&rsquo;ll discuss the nuts and bolts of how to escape in later chapters. </span></p><p class="c256"><span class="c4">On a micro task level, limit the number of items on your to-do list and use impossibly short deadlines to force immediate action while ignoring minutiae. </span></p><p class="c41 c67"><span class="c4">If doing work online or near an online computer, </span><span class="c7">http://e.ggtimer.com/ </span><span class="c4">is a convenient countdown timer. Just type the desired time limit directly into the URL field and hit enter. The http:// can often be omitted. For example: </span></p><p class="c56 c143"><span class="c7">http://e.ggtimer.com/5minutes </span><span class="c4">(or just &ldquo;</span><span class="c7">e.ggtimer.com/5min</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;insomebrowsers) </span><span class="c7">http://e.ggtimer.com/1hour30minutes30seconds http://e.ggtimer.com/30 </span><span class="c4">(if you just put in a number, it assumes seconds) </span></p><p class="c105 c112"><span class="c0">COMFORT CHALLENGE </span></p><p class="c105 c43"><span class="c0">Learn to Propose (2 Days) </span><span class="c4">Stop asking for opinions and start proposing solutions. Begin with the small things. If someone is going to ask, or asks, &ldquo;Where should we eat?&rdquo; &ldquo;What movie should we watch?&rdquo; &ldquo;What should we do tonight?&rdquo; or anything similar, do NOT reflect it back with, &ldquo;Well, what do you want to ... ?&rdquo; </span><span class="c17">Offer a solution</span><span class="c4">. Stop the back-and-forth and make a decision. Practice this in both personal and professional environments. Here are a few lines that help (my favorites are the first and last): </span></p><p class="c82 c317"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Can I make a suggestion?&rdquo; &ldquo;I propose ...&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to propose ...&rdquo; &ldquo;I suggest that ...

Checking Pareto&rsquo;s Law I realized that 78% of my downloads came from just one of my CDs and that 55% of my total download income came from only five songs! It showed me what my fans are looking for and allowed me to showcase those on my web site. Downloads are the way to go. iTunes sells the song and CD Baby direct deposits it to my account. Fully automated once the recording is done. There are some </span></p><p class="c58 c43"><span class="c4">months I can live off download income. Once I finish paying off debt, it should be no problem to travel as an artist and create new fans all over the world and have a cyber income stream. </span></p><p class="c78 c106"><span class="c19">&mdash;VICTOR JOHNSON </span></p><p class="c68 c41 c325"><span class="c4">As for &ldquo;outsourcing&rdquo; your banking, any company that needs to take checks (cheques) should consider a lock box solution. Just about any bank that does business banking offers it. All checks go to a PO box at the bank, the bank processes the checks and deposits them, and according to your instructions can send you a file of all the checks that are deposited. Normally this can be done in either a flat, Excel or other file type that can interface with any accounting systems from Excel, to Quicken to SAP. Quite cost effective. </span></p><p class="c78 c293"><span class="c19">&mdash;ANONYMOUS </span></p><p class="c266"><span class="c0">CULTIVATING SELECTIVE IGNORANCE </span></p><p class="c108"><span class="c4">What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients.

How obscene! I call myself an informed and responsible citizen? How do I stay up- to-date with current affairs? I&rsquo;ll answer all of that, but wait&mdash;it gets better. I usually check business e-mail for about an hour each Monday, and I never check voicemail when abroad. Never ever. </span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c4">But what if someone has an emergency? It doesn&rsquo;t happen. My contacts now know that I don&rsquo;t respond to emergencies, so the emergencies somehow don&rsquo;t exist or don&rsquo;t come to me. Problems, as a rule, solve themselves or disappear if you remove yourself as an information bottleneck and empower others. </span></p><p class="c262"><span class="c13">Cultivating Selective Ignorance </span></p><p class="c219"><span class="c4">There are many things of which a wise man might wish to be ignorant. </span></p><p class="c82 c102"><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c3">RALPH WALDO EMERSON </span><span class="c4">(1803&ndash;1882) </span></p><p class="c84 c43"><span class="c6">F</span><span class="c4">rom this point forward, I&rsquo;m going to propose that you develop an uncanny ability to be selectively ignorant. Ignorance may be bliss, but it is also practical. It is imperative that you learn to ignore or redirect all information and interruptions that are irrelevant, unimportant, or unactionable. Most are all three. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">The first step is to develop and maintain a low-information diet. Just as modern man consumes both too many calories and calories of no nutritional value, information workers eat data both in excess and from the wrong sources. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">Lifestyle design is based on massive action&mdash;output. Increased output necessitates decreased input. Most information is time-consuming, negative, irrelevant to your goals, and outside of your influence. I challenge you to look at whatever you read or watched today and tell me that it wasn&rsquo;t at least two of the four. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">I read the front-page headlines through the newspaper machines as I walk to lunch each day and nothing more. In five years, I haven&rsquo;t had a single problem due to this selective ignorance. It gives you something new to ask the rest of the population in lieu of small talk: &ldquo;Tell me, what&rsquo;s new in the world?&rdquo; And, if it&rsquo;s that important, you&rsquo;ll hear people talking about it. Using my crib notes approach to world affairs, I also retain more than someone who loses the forest for the trees in a sea of extraneous details. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">From an actionable information standpoint, I consume a maximum of one-third of one industry magazine </span><span class="c17">(Response </span><span class="c4">magazine) and one business magazine </span><span class="c17">(Inc.) </span><span class="c4">per month, for a grand total of approximately four hours. That&rsquo;s it for results-oriented reading. I read an hour of fiction prior to bed for relaxation. </span></p><p class="c58 c68 c41"><span class="c4">How on earth do I act responsibly? Let me give an example of how I and other </span><span class="c0">NR </span><span class="c4">both consider and obtain information. I voted in the last presidential election,</span><span class="c9">9 </span><span class="c4">despite having been in Berlin. I made my decision in a matter of hours. First, I sent e-mails to educated friends in the U.S. who share my values and asked them who they were voting for and why. Second, I judge people based on actions and not words; thus, I asked friends in Berlin, who had more perspective outside of U.S. media propaganda, how they judged the candidates based on their historical behavior. Last, I watched the presidential debates. That was it. I let other dependable people synthesize hundreds of hours and thousands of pages of media for me. It was like having dozens of personal information assistants, and I didn&rsquo;t have to pay them a single cent. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">That&rsquo;s a simple example, you say, but what if you need to learn to do something your friends haven&rsquo;t done? Like, say, sell a book to the world&rsquo;s largest publisher as a first-time author? Funny you should ask. There are two approaches I used: </span></p><p class="c56 c43"><span class="c0">1</span><span class="c4">. I picked one book out of dozens based on reader reviews and the fact that the authors had actually done what I wanted to do. If the task is how-to in nature, I only read accounts that are &ldquo;how I did it&rdquo; and autobiographical. No speculators or wannabes are worth the time. </span><span class="c0">2</span><span class="c4">. Using the book to generate intelligent and specific questions, I contacted 10 of the top authors and agents in the world via e-mail and phone, with a response rate of 80%. </span></p><p class="c68 c41 c74"><span class="c4">I only read the sections of the book that were relevant to immediate next steps, which took less than two hours. To develop a template e-mail and call script took approximately four hours, and the actual e-mails and phone calls took less than an hour. This personal contact approach is not only more effective and more efficient than all-you-can-eat info buffets, it also provided me with the major league alliances and mentors necessary to sell this book. Rediscover the power of the forgotten skill called &ldquo;talking.&rdquo; It works. </span></p><p class="c82 c255"><span class="c4">Once again, less is more. </span></p><p class="c105 c300"><span class="c0">How to Read 200% Faster in 10 Minutes </span></p><p class="c43 c84"><span class="c6">T</span><span class="c4">here will be times when, it&rsquo;s true, you will have to read. Here are four simple tips that will lessen the damage and increase your speed at least 200% in 10 minutes with no comprehension loss: </span></p><p class="c56 c131"><span class="c4">1. </span><span class="c19">Two Minutes: </span><span class="c0">Use a pen or finger to trace under each line as you read as fast as possible</span><span class="c4">. Reading is a series of jumping snapshots (called saccades), and using a visual guide prevents regression. 2. </span><span class="c19">Three Minutes: </span><span class="c0">Begin each line focusing on the third word in from the first word, and end each line focusing on the third word in from the last word</span><span class="c4">. This makes use of peripheral vision that is otherwise wasted on margins. </span></p><p class="c58 c166"><span class="c4">For example, even when the highlighted words in the next line are your beginning and ending focal points, the entire sentence is &ldquo;read,&rdquo; just with less eye movement: </span></p><p class="c48 c41 c197"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Once upon </span><span class="c0">a </span><span class="c4">time, an information addict </span><span class="c0">decided </span><span class="c4">to detox.&rdquo; Move in from both sides further and further as it gets easier. </span></p><p class="c56 c166"><span class="c4">3. </span><span class="c19">Two Minutes: </span><span class="c0">Once comfortable indenting three or four words from both sides, attempt to take only two snapshots&mdash;also known as fixations&mdash;per line on the first and last indented words</span><span class="c4">. 4. </span><span class="c19">Three Minutes: </span><span class="c0">Practice reading too fast for comprehension but with good technique (the above three techniques) for five pages prior to reading at a comfortable speed</span><span class="c4">. This will heighten perception and reset your speed limit, much like how 50 mph normally feels fast but seems like slow motion if you drop down from 70 mph on the freeway. </span></p><p class="c46 c43 c41"><span class="c4">To calculate reading speed in words per minute (wpm)&mdash;and thus progress&mdash;in a given book, add up the number of words in ten lines and divide by ten to get the average words per line. Multiply this by the number of lines per page and you have the average words per page. Now it&rsquo;s simple. If you initially read 1.25 pages in one minute at 330 average words per page, that&rsquo;s 412.5 words per minute. If you then read 3.5 pages after training, it&rsquo;s 1,155 words per minute and you&rsquo;re in the top 1% of the world&rsquo;s fastest readers. </span></p><p class="c105 c94"><span class="c0">Q&amp;A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS </span></p><p class="c56 c175"><span class="c4">Learning to ignore things is one of the great paths to inner peace. </span></p><p class="c82 c338"><span class="c4">&mdash;</span><span class="c3">ROBERT J.

Information is too much like ice cream to do otherwise. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll just have a half a spoonful&rdquo; is about as realistic as &ldquo;I just want to jump online for a minute.&rdquo; Go cold turkey. </span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c4">If you want to go back to the 15,000-calorie potato chip information diet afterward, fine, but beginning tomorrow and for at least five full days, here are the rules: </span></p><p class="c48 c43"><span class="c0">No </span><span class="c4">newspapers, magazines, audiobooks, or nonmusic radio. Music is permitted at all times. </span><span class="c0">No </span><span class="c4">news websites whatsoever (</span><span class="c7">cnn.com</span><span class="c4">, </span><span class="c7">drudgereport.com</span><span class="c4">, </span><span class="c7">msn.com</span><span class="c4">,</span><span class="c9">10 </span><span class="c4">etc.). </span><span class="c0">No </span><span class="c4">television at all, except for one hour of pleasure viewing each evening. </span><span class="c0">No </span><span class="c4">reading books, except for this book and one hour of </span><span class="c17">fiction</span><span class="c9">11 </span><span class="c4">pleasure reading prior to bed. </span></p><p class="c32 c68"><span class="c0">No </span><span class="c4">web surfing at the desk unless it is necessary to complete a work task for </span><span class="c17">that day</span><span class="c4">. Necessary means necessary, not nice to have. </span></p><p class="c141 c268"><span class="c4">Unnecessary reading is public enemy number one during this one-week fast. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">What do you do with all the extra time? Replace the newspaper at breakfast with speaking to your spouse, bonding with your children, or learning the principles in this book. Between 9&ndash;5, complete your top priorities as per the last chapter. If you complete them with time to spare, do the exercises in this book. Recommending this book might seem hypocritical, but it&rsquo;s not: The information in these pages is both important and to be applied now, not tomorrow or the day after. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">Each day at lunch break, and no earlier, get your five-minute news fix. Ask a well- informed colleague or a restaurant waiter, &ldquo;Anything important happening in the world today? I couldn&rsquo;t get the paper today.&rdquo; Stop this as soon as you realize that the answer doesn&rsquo;t affect your actions at all. Most people won&rsquo;t even remember what they spent one to two hours absorbing that morning. </span></p><p class="c82 c43"><span class="c4">Be strict with yourself. I can prescribe the medicine, but you need to take it.

You can block sites within fixed time periods (e.g., between 9am and 5pm), after a time limit (e.g., 10 minutes in every hour), or with a combination of time periods and time limit (e.g., 10 minutes in every hour between 9am and 5pm). You can also set a password for access to the extension options, just to slow you down in moments of weakness! </span></p><p class="c74 c43"><span class="c4">2. </span><span class="c0">Develop the habit of asking yourself, &ldquo;Will I definitely use this information for something immediate and important?&rdquo; </span><span class="c4">It&rsquo;s not enough to use information for &ldquo;something&rdquo;&mdash;it needs to be immediate and important. If &ldquo;no&rdquo; on either count, don&rsquo;t consume it. Information is useless if it is not applied to something important or if you will forget it before you have a chance to apply it. </span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c4">I used to have the habit of reading a book or site to prepare for an event weeks or months in the future, and I would then need to reread the same material when the deadline for action was closer.

If you&rsquo;re full after half a plate of ribs, put the damn fork down and don&rsquo;t order dessert. </span></p><p class="c82 c41 c332"><span class="c4">More is not better, and stopping something is often 10 times better than finishing it.

Remember that the real goal is not to get numbers, but to get over the fear of asking, so the outcome is unimportant.

Common time wasters include meetings, discussions, phone calls, web surfing, and e-mail that are </span><span class="c17">unimportant</span><span class="c4">. </span></p><p class="c31"><span class="c4">2. </span><span class="c0">Time consumers: </span><span class="c4">repetitive tasks or requests that need to be completed but often interrupt high-level work.

It is a matter of limiting access and funneling all communication toward immediate action. </span></p><p class="c32 c43 c41"><span class="c4">First, limit e-mail consumption and production. This is the greatest single interruption in the modern world. </span></p><p class="c138 c287"><span class="c4">1. Turn off the audible alert if you have one on Outlook or a similar program and turn off automatic send/receive, which delivers e-mail to your inbox as soon as someone sends them. </span></p><p class="c182 c287"><span class="c4">2.

I would recommend that you do not ask to implement this. Remember one of our ten commandments: Beg for forgiveness; don&rsquo;t ask for permission. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">If this gives you heart palpitations, speak with your immediate supervisor and propose to trial the approach for one to three days. Cite pending projects and frustration with constant interruptions as the reasons. Feel free to blame it on spam or someone outside of the office. </span></p><p class="c82 c229"><span class="c4">Here is a simple e-mail template that can be used: </span></p><p class="c56 c290"><span class="c4">Greetings, Friends [or Esteemed Colleagues], </span></p><p class="c78 c93 c95"><span class="c4">Due to high workload, I am currently checking and responding to e-mail twice daily at 12:00 p.m. ET [or your time zone] and 4:00 p.m. ET. </span></p><p class="c32 c93 c95"><span class="c4">If you require urgent assistance (please ensure it is urgent) that cannot wait until either 12:00 p.m. or 4:00 p.m., please contact me via phone at 555&ndash;555&ndash;5555. </span></p><p class="c82 c93 c95"><span class="c4">Thank you for understanding this move to more efficiency and effectiveness.

Emergencies are seldom that. People are poor judges of importance and inflate minutiae to fill time and feel important. This autoresponse is a tool that, far from decreasing collective effectiveness, forces people to re-evaluate their reason for interrupting you and helps them decrease meaningless and time-consuming contact. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">I was initially terrified of missing important requests and inviting disaster, just as you might be upon reading this recommendation. Nothing happened. Give it a shot and work out the small bumps as you progress. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">For an extreme example of a personal autoresponder that has never prompted a complaint and allowed me to check e-mail once per week, send an e-mail to </span><span class="c7">template@fourhourworkweek.com</span><span class="c4">. It has been revised over three years and works like a charm. </span></p><p class="c82 c243"><span class="c4">The second step is to screen incoming and limit outgoing phone calls. </span></p><p class="c46 c43"><span class="c0">1</span><span class="c4">. Use two telephone numbers if possible&mdash;one office line (non urgent) and one cellular (urgent). This could also be two cell phones, or the non-urgent line could be an Internet phone number that routes calls to online voicemail (</span><span class="c7">www.skype.com</span><span class="c4">, for example). </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">Use the cell number in the e-mail autoresponse and answer it at all times unless it is an unknown caller or it is a call you don&rsquo;t want to answer. If in doubt, allow the call to go to voicemail and listen to the voicemail immediately afterward to gauge importance. If it can wait, let it wait. The offending parties have to learn to wait. </span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c4">The office phone should be put on silent mode and allowed to go to voicemail at all times. The voicemail recording should sound familiar: </span></p><p class="c48 c77"><span class="c4">You&rsquo;ve reached the desk of Tim Ferriss. I am currently checking and responding to voicemail twice daily at 12:00 p.m. ET [or your time zone] and 4:00 p.m. ET. </span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c4">If you require assistance with a truly urgent matter that cannot wait until either 12:00 p.m. or 4:00 p.m., please contact me on my cell at 555&ndash;555&ndash;5555. Otherwise, please leave a message and I will return it at the next of those two times. Be sure to leave your e-mail address, as I am often able to respond faster that way. </span><span class="c45">Thank you for understanding this move to more efficiency and effectiveness. It </span><span class="c4">helps me accomplish more to serve you better. </span></p><p class="c51"><span class="c4">Have a wonderful day. </span></p><p class="c58 c68"><span class="c0">2</span><span class="c4">. If someone does call your cell phone, it is presumably urgent and should be treated as such. Do not allow them to consume time otherwise. It&rsquo;s all in the greeting. Compare the following: </span></p><p class="c48 c302"><span class="c0">Jane </span><span class="c4">(receiver)</span><span class="c0">:</span><span class="c4">Hello? </span><span class="c0">John </span><span class="c4">(caller)</span><span class="c0">: </span><span class="c4">Hi, is this Jane? </span><span class="c0">Jane: </span><span class="c4">This is Jane. </span><span class="c0">John: </span><span class="c4">Hi, Jane, it&rsquo;s John. </span><span class="c0">Jane: </span><span class="c4">Oh, hi, John. How are you? (or) Oh, hi, John. What&rsquo;s going on? </span></p><p class="c74 c68"><span class="c4">John will now digress and lead you into a conversation about nothing, from which you will have to recover and then fish out the ultimate purpose of the call. There is a better approach: </span></p><p class="c56 c258"><span class="c0">Jane: </span><span class="c4">This is Jane speaking. </span><span class="c0">John: </span><span class="c4">Hi, it&rsquo;s John. </span><span class="c0">Jane: </span><span class="c4">Hi, John. I&rsquo;m right in the middle of something. How can I help you out? </span></p><p class="c141 c238"><span class="c4">Potential continuation: </span></p><p class="c48 c306"><span class="c0">John: </span><span class="c4">Oh, I can call back. </span><span class="c0">Jane: </span><span class="c4">No, I have a minute. What can I do for you? </span></p><p class="c71 c43"><span class="c4">Don&rsquo;t encourage people to chitchat and don&rsquo;t let them chitchat. Get them to the point immediately. If they meander or try to postpone for a later undefined call, reel them in and get them to come to the point. If they go into a long description of a problem, cut in with, &ldquo;[Name], sorry to interrupt, but I have a call in five minutes. What can I do to help out?&rdquo; You might instead say, &ldquo;[Name], sorry to interrupt, but I have a call in five minutes. Can you send me an e-mail?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c141 c169"><span class="c4">The third step is to master the art of refusal and avoiding meetings. </span></p><p class="c74 c68"><span class="c4">T</span><span class="c3">HE FIRST DAY </span><span class="c4">our new Sales VP arrived at TrueSAN in 2001, he came into the all- company meeting and made an announcement in just about this many words: &ldquo;I am not here to make friends. I have been hired to build a sales team and sell product, and that&rsquo;s what I intend to do. Thanks.&rdquo; So much for small talk. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">He proceeded to deliver on his promise. The office socializers disliked him for his no-nonsense approach to communication, but everyone respected his time. He wasn&rsquo;t rude without reason, but he was direct and kept the people around him focused. Some didn&rsquo;t consider him charismatic, but no one considered him anything less than spectacularly effective. </span></p><p class="c58 c68 c41"><span class="c4">I remember sitting down in his office for our first one-on-one meeting. Fresh off four years of rigorous academic training, I immediately jumped into explaining the prospect profiles, elaborate planning I&rsquo;d developed, responses to date, and so forth and so on. I had spent at least two hours preparing to make this first impression a good one. He listened with a smile on his face for no more than two minutes and then held up a hand. I stopped. He laughed in a kind-hearted manner and said, &ldquo;Tim, I don&rsquo;t want the story. Just tell me what we need to do.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">Over the following weeks, he trained me to recognize when I was unfocused or focused on the wrong things, which meant anything that didn&rsquo;t move the top two or three clients one step closer to signing a purchase order. Our meetings were now no more than five minutes long. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">From this moment forward, resolve to keep those around you focused and avoid all meetings, whether in person or remote, that do not have clear objectives. It is possible to do this tactfully, but expect that some time wasters will be offended the first few times their advances are rejected. Once it is clear that remaining on task is your policy and not subject to change, they will accept it and move on with life. Hard feelings pass. Don&rsquo;t suffer fools or you&rsquo;ll become one. </span></p><p class="c43 c41 c78"><span class="c17">It is your job to train those around you to be effective and efficient</span><span class="c4">. No one else will do it for you. Here are a few recommendations: </span></p><p class="c46 c43"><span class="c0">1</span><span class="c4">. Decide that, given the non-urgent nature of most issues, you will steer people toward the following means of communication, in order of preference: e-mail, phone, and in-person meetings. If someone proposes a meeting, request an e-mail instead and then use the phone as your fallback offer if need be. Cite other immediately pending work tasks as the reason. </span></p><p class="c40"><span class="c0">2</span><span class="c4">. Respond to voicemail via e-mail whenever possible. This trains people to be concise. Help them develop the habit. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">Similar to our opening greeting on the phone, e-mail communication should be streamlined to prevent needless back-and-forth. Thus, an e-mail with &ldquo;Can you meet at 4:00 </span><span class="c3">P.M.?</span><span class="c4">&rdquo; would become &ldquo;Can you meet at 4:00 </span><span class="c3">P.M.? </span><span class="c4">If so If not, please advise three other times that work for you.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">This &ldquo;if ... then&rdquo; structure becomes more important as you check e-mail less often. Since I only check e-mail once a week, it is critical that no one needs a &ldquo;what if?&rdquo; answered or other information within seven days of a given e-mail I send. If I suspect that a manufacturing order hasn&rsquo;t arrived at the shipping facility, for example, I&rsquo;ll send an e-mail to my shipping facility manager along these lines: &ldquo;Dear Susan ... Has the new manufacturing shipment arrived? If so, please advise me on ... If not, please contact John Doe at 555&ndash;5555 or via e-mail at john@doe.com (he is also CC&rsquo;d) and advise on delivery date and tracking. John, if there are any issues with the shipment, please coordinate with Susan, reachable at 555&ndash;4444, who has the authority to make decisions up to $500 on my behalf. In case of emergency, call me on my cell phone, but I trust you two. Thanks.&rdquo; This prevents most follow-up questions, avoids two separate dialogues, and takes me out of the problem-solving equation. </span></p><p class="c32 c43 c41"><span class="c4">Get into the habit of considering what &ldquo;if ... then&rdquo; actions can be proposed in any e- mail where you ask a question. </span></p><p class="c68 c71"><span class="c0">3</span><span class="c4">. Meetings should only be held to make decisions about a predefined situation, not to define the problem. If someone proposes that you meet with them or &ldquo;set a time to talk on the phone,&rdquo; ask that person to send you an e-mail with an agenda to define the purpose: </span></p><p class="c59"><span class="c4">That sounds doable. So I can best prepare, can you please send me an e-mail with an agenda? That is, the topics and questions we&rsquo;ll need to address? That would be great. Thanks in advance. </span></p><p class="c43 c41 c105"><span class="c4">Don&rsquo;t give them a chance to bail out. The &ldquo;thanks in advance&rdquo; before a retort increases your chances of getting the e-mail. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">The e-mail medium forces people to define the desired outcome of a meeting or call. Nine times out of ten, a meeting is unnecessary and you can answer the questions, once defined, via e-mail. Impose this habit on others. I haven&rsquo;t had an in- person meeting for my business in more than five years and have had fewer than a dozen conference calls, all lasting less than 30 minutes. </span></p><p class="c74 c68"><span class="c4">4. Speaking of 30 minutes, if you absolutely cannot stop a meeting or call from happening, </span><span class="c17">define the end time</span><span class="c4">. Do not leave these discussions open-ended, and keep them short. If things are well-defined, decisions should not take more than 30 minutes. Cite other commitments at odd times to make them more believable (e.g., 3:20 vs. 3:30) and force people to focus instead of socializing, commiserating, and digressing. If you must join a meeting that is scheduled to last a long time or that is open-ended, inform the organizer that you would like permission to cover your portion first, as you have a commitment in 15 minutes. If you have to, feign an urgent phone call. Get the hell out of there and have someone else update you later. The other option is to be completely transparent and voice your opinion of how unnecessary the meeting is. If you choose this route, be prepared to face fire and offer alternatives. </span></p><p class="c71 c68"><span class="c4">5. The cubicle is your temple&mdash;don&rsquo;t permit casual visitors. Some suggest using a clear &ldquo;do not disturb&rdquo; sign of some type, but I have found that this is ignored unless you have an office. My approach was to put headphones on, even if I wasn&rsquo;t listening to anything. If someone approached me despite this discouragement, I would pretend to be on the phone. I&rsquo;d put a finger to my lips, say something like, &ldquo;I hear you,&rdquo; and then say into the mic, &ldquo;Can you hold on a second?&rdquo; Next, I&rsquo;d turn to the invader and say, &ldquo;Hi. What can I do for you?&rdquo; I wouldn&rsquo;t let them &ldquo;get back to me&rdquo; but rather force the person to give me a five-second summary and then send me an e-mail if necessary. </span></p><p class="c38 c41"><span class="c4">If headphone games aren&rsquo;t your thing, the reflexive response to an invader should be the same as when answering the cell phone: &ldquo;Hi, invader. I&rsquo;m right in the middle of </span></p><p class="c58 c68"><span class="c4">something. How can I be of help?&rdquo; If it&rsquo;s not clear within 30 seconds, ask the person to send you an e-mail about the chosen issue; do not offer to send them an e-mail first: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be happy to help, but I have to finish this first. Can you send me a quick e-mail to remind me?&rdquo; If you still cannot deflect an invader, give the person a time limit on your availability, which can also be used for phone conversations: &ldquo;OK, I only have two minutes before a call, but what&rsquo;s the situation and what can I do to help?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c71 c43"><span class="c0">6</span><span class="c4">. Use the Puppy Dog Close to help your superiors and others develop the no-meeting habit. The Puppy Dog Close in sales is so named because it is based on the pet store sales approach: If someone likes a puppy but is hesitant to make the life-altering purchase, just offer to let them take the pup home and bring it back if they change their minds. Of course, the return seldom happens. </span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c4">The Puppy Dog Close is invaluable whenever you face resistance to permanent changes. Get your foot in the door with a &ldquo;let&rsquo;s just try it once&rdquo; reversible trial. </span></p><p class="c82 c297"><span class="c4">Compare the following: </span></p><p class="c59"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d love this puppy. It will forever add to your responsibilities until he dies 10 years from now. No more care-free vacations, and you&rsquo;ll finally get to pick up poop all over the city&mdash;what do you think?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c48 c103"><span class="c4">vs. </span></p><p class="c141 c68 c41"><span class="c4">Now imagine walking up to your boss in the hallway and clapping a hand on her shoulder: </span></p><p class="c56 c77"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to go to the meeting, but I have a better idea. Let&rsquo;s never have another one, since all we do is waste time and not decide anything useful.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c56 c103"><span class="c4">vs. </span></p><p class="c74 c68 c41"><span class="c4">The second set of alternatives seem less permanent, and they&rsquo;re intended to appear so. Repeat this routine and ensure that you achieve more outside of the meeting than the attendees do within it; repeat the disappearing act as often as possible and cite improved productivity to convert this slowly into a permanent routine change. </span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c4">Learn to imitate any good child: &ldquo;Just this once! Please!!! I promise I&rsquo;ll do X!&rdquo; Parents fall for it because kids help adults to fool themselves. It works with bosses, suppliers, customers, and the rest of the world, too. </span></p><p class="c57 c41"><span class="c4">Use it, but don&rsquo;t fall for it. If a boss asks for overtime &ldquo;just this once,&rdquo; he or she will expect it in the future. </span></p><p class="c44"><span class="c13">Time Consumers: Batch and Do Not Falter </span></p><p class="c32 c170"><span class="c4">A schedule defends from chaos and whim. &mdash;</span><span class="c3">ANNIE DILLARD, </span><span class="c4">winner of Pulitzer Prize in nonfiction, 1975 </span></p><p class="c43 c76"><span class="c6">I</span><span class="c4">f you have never used a commercial printer before, the pricing and lead times could surprise you. </span></p><p class="c57 c41"><span class="c4">Let&rsquo;s assume it costs $310 and takes one week to print 20 customized T-shirts with 4-color logos. How much and how long does it take to print 3 of the same T-shirt? </span></p><p class="c38"><span class="c4">$310 and one week. How is that possible? Simple&mdash;the setup charges don&rsquo;t change. It costs the printer the same amount in materials for plate preparation ($150) and the same in labor to man the press itself ($100). The setup is the real time-consumer, and thus the job, despite its small size, needs to be scheduled just like the other, resulting in the same one-week delivery date. The lower economy of scale picks up the rest: The cost for 3 shirts is $20 per shirt </span><span class="c0">x </span><span class="c4">3 shirts instead of $3 per shirt </span><span class="c0">x </span><span class="c4">20 shirts. </span></p><p class="c115 c68"><span class="c4">The cost- and time-effective solution, therefore, is to wait until you have a larger order, an approach called &ldquo;batching.&rdquo; Batching is also the solution to our distracting but necessary </span><span class="c0">time consumers</span><span class="c4">, those repetitive tasks that interrupt the most important. If you check mail and make bill payments five times a week, it might take 30 minutes per instance and you respond to a total of 20 letters in two and a half hours. If you do this once per week instead, it might take 60 minutes total and you still respond to a total of 20 letters. People do the former out of fear of emergencies. First, there are seldom real emergencies. Second, of the urgent communication you will receive, missing a deadline is usually reversible and otherwise costs a minimum to correct. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">There is an inescapable setup time for all tasks, large or minuscule in scale. It is often the same for one as it is for a hundred. There is a psychological switching of gears that can require up to 45 minutes to resume a major task that has been interrupted. More than a quarter of each 9&ndash;5 period (28%) is consumed by such interruptions.</span><span class="c9">13 </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">This is true of all recurring tasks and is precisely why we have already decided to check e-mail and phone calls twice per day at </span><span class="c17">specific predetermined times </span><span class="c4">(between which we let them accumulate). </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">From mid-2004 to 2007, I checked mail no more than once a week, often not for up to four weeks at a time. Nothing was irreparable, and nothing cost more than $300 to fix. This batching has saved me hundreds of hours of redundant work. How much is your time worth? </span></p><p class="c78 c114"><span class="c4">Let&rsquo;s use a hypothetical example: </span></p><p class="c118 c68"><span class="c4">1. $20 per hour is how much you are paid or value your time. This would be the case, for example, if you are paid $40,000 per year and get two weeks of vacation per year ($40,000 divided by [40 hours per week </span><span class="c0">x </span><span class="c4">50 = 2,000] = $20/hour). Estimate your hourly income by cutting the last three zeroes off of your annual income and halving the remaining number (e.g., $50,000/year p $25/hour. </span></p><p class="c58 c43"><span class="c4">2. Estimate the amount of time you will save by grouping similar tasks together and batching them, and calculate how much you have earned by multiplying this hour number by your per-hour rate ($20 here): </span></p><p class="c43 c110"><span class="c0">3</span><span class="c4">. Test each of the above batching frequencies and determine how much problems cost to fix in each period. If the cost is less than the above dollar amounts, batch even further apart. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">For example, using our above math, if I check e-mail once per week and that results in an average loss of two sales per week, totaling $80 in lost profit, I will continue checking once per week because $200 (10 hours of time) minus $80 is still a $120 net gain, not to mention the enormous benefits of completing other main tasks in those 10 hours. If you calculate the financial and emotional benefit of completing just one main task (such as landing a major client or completing a life-changing trip), the value of batching is much more than the per-hour savings. </span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c4">If the problems cost more than hours saved, scale back to the next-less-frequent batch schedule. In this case, I would drop from once per week to twice per week (not daily) and attempt to fix the system so that I can return to once per week. Do not work harder when the solution is working smarter. I have batched both personal and business tasks further and further apart as I&rsquo;ve realized just how few real problems come up. Some of my scheduled batches in 2007 were e-mail (Mondays 10:00 </span><span class="c3">A.M.), </span><span class="c4">phone (completely eliminated), laundry (every other Sunday at 10:00 </span><span class="c3">P.M.), </span><span class="c4">credit cards and bills (most are on automatic payment, but I check balances every second Monday after e-mail), strength training (every 4th day for 30 minutes), etc. </span></p><p class="c53"><span class="c13">Empowerment Failure: Rules and Readjustment </span></p><p class="c146 c65"><span class="c4">The vision is really about empowering workers, giving them all the information about what&rsquo;s going on so they can do a lot more than they&rsquo;ve done in the past. &mdash;</span><span class="c3">BILL GATES</span><span class="c4">, cofounder of Microsoft, richest man in the world </span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c6">E</span><span class="c4">mpowerment failure refers to being unable to accomplish a task without first obtaining permission or information. It is often a case of being micromanaged or micromanaging someone else, both of which consume </span><span class="c17">your </span><span class="c4">time. </span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c4">For the employee, the goal is to have full access to necessary information and as much independent decision-making ability as possible. For the entrepreneur, the goal </span></p><p class="c32 c43"><span class="c4">is to grant as much information and independent decision-making ability to employees or contractors as possible. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4">Customer service is often the epitome of empowerment failure, and a personal example from BrainQUICKEN illustrates just how serious but easily solved the problem can be. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">In 2002, I had outsourced customer service for order tracking and returns but still handled product-related questions myself. The result? I received more than 200 e-mail per day, spending all hours between 9&ndash;5 responding to them, and the volume was growing at a rate of more than 10% per week! I had to cancel advertising and limit shipments, as additional customer service would have been the final nail in the coffin. It wasn&rsquo;t </span><span class="c17">a scalable </span><span class="c4">model. Remember this word, as it will be important later. It wasn&rsquo;t scalable because there was an information and decision bottleneck: me. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">The clincher? The bulk of the e-mail that landed in my inbox was not product- related at all but requests from the outsourced customer service reps seeking permission for different actions: </span></p><p class="c48 c330"><span class="c4">The customer claims he didn&rsquo;t receive the shipment. What should we do? The customer had a bottle held at customs. Can we reship to a U.S. address? </span></p><p class="c281 c68"><span class="c4">The customer needs the product for a competition in two days. Can we ship overnight, and if so, how much should we charge? </span></p><p class="c105 c43"><span class="c4">It was endless. Hundreds upon hundreds of different situations made it impractical to write a manual, and I didn&rsquo;t have the time or experience to do so regardless. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">Fortunately, someone did have the experience: the outsourced reps themselves. I sent one single e-mail to all the supervisors that immediately turned 200 e-mail per day into fewer than 20 e-mail per week: </span></p><p class="c48 c275"><span class="c4">Hi All, </span></p><p class="c82 c65 c181"><span class="c4">I would like to establish a new policy for my account that overrides all others. </span></p><p class="c78 c65 c181"><span class="c4">Keep the customer happy. If it is a problem that takes less than $100 to fix, use your judgment and fix it yourself. </span></p><p class="c65 c181 c214"><span class="c4">This is official written permission and a request to fix all problems that cost under $100 without contacting me. I am no longer your customer; my customers are your customer. Don&rsquo;t ask me for permission. Do what you think is right, and we&rsquo;ll make adjustments as we go along. </span></p><p class="c52"><span class="c4">Thank you, Tim </span></p><p class="c118 c68 c41"><span class="c4">Upon close analysis, it became clear that more than 90% of the issues that prompted e-mail could be resolved for less than $20. I reviewed the financial results of their independent decision-making on a weekly basis for four weeks, then a monthly basis, and then on a quarterly basis. </span></p></body></html>
